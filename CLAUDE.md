# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for working in this repository. ReCue is a **macOS and Windows** desktop
app (#139/#140/#143) for running and managing many live `claude` CLI sessions at once.
Per-OS divergence is `#[cfg(...)]`-gated in Rust and a single store-cached `platform`
signal in the frontend; the macOS arm is always the original behavior.

## ⚠️ Cross-platform is a hard requirement (read this first)

**ReCue ships on BOTH macOS and Windows. Every feature, fix, and refactor MUST
be functional on both platforms — no exceptions.** This is not aspirational; it is a
release constraint. macOS-only and Windows-only are both bugs.

When you implement *anything*, treat "does this work on the other OS?" as part of the
definition of done — before you consider the task complete, walk the change against
Windows **and** macOS in your head (and verify on a real box when the path can't be
unit-tested). Concretely:

- **Never assume one OS.** No hardcoded `/`-paths, POSIX-only shell-outs, `$HOME`,
  `open`/`explorer.exe`, `Cmd`-only key handling, or macOS-only system calls in a
  code path that runs on both. If a primitive differs by OS, it gets an abstraction.
- **Gate genuine divergence explicitly** — `#[cfg(windows)]` / `#[cfg(unix)]` /
  `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` in Rust (with the *other* arm always provided, never
  left to fail to compile), and the store-cached **`platform`** signal +
  `src/platform.ts` helpers in the frontend. The macOS arm always preserves the
  original behavior byte-for-byte; the Windows arm is additive.
- **Reuse the established cross-platform seams instead of re-deriving them** — Rust:
  `path_env::home_dir()` (`%USERPROFILE%` on Windows, never raw `$HOME`),
  `git::hidden_command()` (the `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` console-flash guard — **every**
  shelled-out `git`/CLI probe goes through it), `pty::resolve_command()` /
  `find_on_path` / `launch_target` (PATHEXT + `cmd.exe /C` for `.cmd` agents),
  `commands.rs` path-segment guards (`windows_safe_seg` for reserved device names);
  Frontend: `joinPath` / `splitPath` (split on `/` **or** `\`), `kbdHint` /
  `revealLabel` (⌘↔Ctrl, "Reveal in Finder"↔"Reveal in Explorer"), `openUrl`→the
  http/https-only `open_url`, and `metaKey || ctrlKey` for **every** shortcut handler.
- **CSS / WebView too:** WKWebView (macOS) and WebView2/Chromium (Windows) diverge —
  prefer `::-webkit-scrollbar` styling, ship plain-color fallbacks alongside
  `color-mix`, and avoid macOS-only `-webkit-`/vibrancy effects without a fallback.
- **Mirror docs across the OS divide.** User-facing copy that names a platform reads
  "macOS and Windows" (or routes through `kbdHint`/`revealLabel`), never "macOS only."
- **When a path genuinely can't be unit-tested on CI** (GUI spawn, installer, ConPTY
  reflow), implement it for both OSes anyway and record what still needs a real-box
  check in **`TRAJECTORY_TO_WINDOWS.md`** (the running log of Windows parity work) —
  do not silently ship a macOS-only path.

If a task as written would only work on one OS, that is a defect in the task: build
the cross-platform version (gating divergence as above), not the single-OS shortcut.
The detailed per-subsystem notes throughout this doc and `TRAJECTORY_TO_WINDOWS.md`
show how each existing feature already honors this.

## What this app is

An **Overview** "agent wall" of real terminals, a **Canvas** split-panel workspace
(with file, **git-diff**, and terminal viewers), and a repo-grouped **sidebar**. A
Canvas tab can **pop out into its own native window** for multi-monitor use (#84).
Each session is a **real PTY running `claude`** — ReCue provides the window
chrome, navigation, persistence, and git-reading; the terminals come from the
Claude Code CLI itself.

`claude` is assumed to be installed and authenticated on `PATH` (the app surfaces a
clear error if it is missing). Because a bundled `.app` launched from Finder/Dock
inherits launchd's minimal `PATH` (not the shell's), `run()` first calls
`path_env::restore_user_path()` to adopt the **login-shell PATH** at startup
(release builds only) — without it `claude` reads as "not found" in `tauri build`
even though it works in `tauri dev`.

## Stack

- **Tauri 2** desktop shell (macOS + Windows — see the cross-platform requirement above)
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite, **Zustand** for state, plain CSS with
  CSS-variable design tokens (CSS Modules), **xterm.js** terminals (⌘-clickable
  `http`/`https` links via `@xterm/addon-web-links`, #109), **Lucide**
  icons, **JetBrains Mono** (bundled, offline), **react-markdown + remark-gfm**
  (GFM markdown, no raw HTML) + **Prism.js** (curated-language code highlighting —
  JS/TS/JSX, Rust, Python, JSON/YAML/TOML, CSS, markup, Bash, **Java**, **INI/.env/
  .properties** #150) — both in the universal **`FileViewer`** (#40/#44), whose **raw
  markdown / plain-text** view is an editable, auto-saving `<textarea>` (#148); the same
  markdown stack also renders the markdown **Kanban board** (#141–#151). **mermaid**
  (#254 — lazy-loaded, bundled/offline, never a CDN) renders ` ```mermaid ` fences as
  diagrams in the FileViewer's rendered markdown only. **dnd-kit**
  (`@dnd-kit/core` + `/sortable` — the app's one drag-and-drop system, #43; also Kanban
  card DnD #143), **react-resizable-panels** (Canvas split resizing, #46)
- **Backend (Rust, `src-tauri/`):** **`portable-pty`** for terminals, JSON
  persistence in the app-data dir, read-only git (shells out to `git`), and the
  Tauri **dialog** (folder picker) plugin
- Dark theme only

## Architecture (data flow)

- **Spawn:** `spawn_session(cwd, name)` → `SessionManager` (`pty.rs`) opens a PTY
  running `claude --session-id <uuid>`, registers it by id, and persists a record
  (`store.rs`). A per-session reader thread pushes output to a bounded scrollback
  buffer and an `mpsc` channel. A **fork** (#126, `fork_session`) is a spawn variant
  that branches a source agent's conversation into a new parallel session
  (`--session-id <new> --resume <source> --fork-session`) — see Conventions.
- **Output:** `lib.rs` forwards the channel to the `session://output` /
  `session://exited` / `session://state` Tauri events. The frontend `ipc.ts`
  subscription routes output **bytes** to `outputBus.ts` (a pub/sub the xterm
  `Terminal` consumes — deliberately *not* React state) and lifecycle +
  busy/idle to the Zustand `store.ts`.
- **Busy indicator (#42/#55/#71/#88/#95/#112/#116):** a backend monitor thread (`pty.rs`) derives each
  session's **busy/idle** from output activity (within a ~700ms window) and emits
  `session://state { id, busy }` on transitions only. So **keystroke echo doesn't
  read as busy** (#55), `write_stdin` stamps a per-session `last_input` time and the
  monitor marks busy only when output arrived ≥300ms *after* the last keystroke.
  Busy also requires the session to have **work to do** (#116) — either the user has
  submitted input, or it booted **prompt-seeded** (#93, an `ActivityState.seeded`
  flag set by `spawn_session_with_prompt`) — so `claude`'s pre-input **startup paint
  never reads as busy** (it used to, latching the yellow "needs input" state before
  any prompt); a fresh interactive session stays gray until its first real turn,
  while a seeded/scheduled agent still goes blue→yellow. The
  store keeps `sessionBusy` plus a per-session **has-been-active** flag; the
  `BusyIndicator` (#88, supersedes #71's spinner arc) has **three states** (#112): a
  calm `--status-idle` (gray) dot when **fresh** (never active); while busy, a
  `--status-running` (Blue) **Claude-style shimmer** — a soft sheen **sweeping across
  it** (animated `background-position` on a `::after` sheen, the dot via `::before` —
  no extra DOM); and once it has worked and gone idle again, a **settled**
  `--status-awaiting` (yellow) dot with a soft glow and no animation ("finished —
  needs input"). It is **always rendered** as a ~10px dot in a fixed ~14px slot (#95)
  so the footprint never shifts, and placed **before the agent's name** — in the
  sidebar rows and Overview card headers. "Has been active" is **persisted**
  (`has_been_active` on the record, set once on the first busy edge in `lib.rs`,
  seeded into the store on load) so a previously-active agent shows yellow immediately
  on boot. Under reduced-motion the sweep is dropped, leaving a solid glowing blue dot
  (and a solid yellow settled dot) distinct from idle.
- **Input / resize:** the `Terminal` sends keystrokes to `write_stdin` and a
  `ResizeObserver` drives `resize_pty`.
- **Persistence / resume:** records + recents survive restarts; on boot the
  manager best-effort `resume_session`s each via `claude --resume <id>`.
- **Git:** `working_diff(cwd)` / `current_branch(cwd)` / `compare_branches(cwd, base,
  target)` (the #81 two-dot branch compare) shell out to `git`; the `DiffInspector` and
  sidebar render the structured result. The `DiffInspector` shows the changed files in a
  **Focused** (one file + a ‹/› prev/next strip) or **Accordion** (single-open cards)
  mode (#231, persisted #237), and is **keyboard-navigable** (#255): the panel is
  focusable (`tabIndex`, token `:focus-visible`) and a **panel-scoped** `onKeyDown` steps
  between files with **←/→ in Focused** (Up/Down still scroll the body) and **↑/↓ in
  Accordion** (scrolling the open card into view) via the pure `diffNavDelta`
  (`DiffInspector/diffNav.ts`) + the existing wrapping `stepFile` — plain unmodified
  arrows (identical on macOS/Windows), ignored while an input/select/picker-listbox has
  focus or there are <2 files, so other diff panels / terminals are unaffected.
  `list_branches` returns both **local** (`all`)
  and **remote-tracking** (`remote`, qualified `<remote>/<name>`, deduped vs local,
  `*/HEAD` excluded) branches (#180); `fetch_remotes(cwd)` runs a best-effort `git
  fetch --prune` (the app's first git **network** read, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so a
  private remote fails fast) to refresh them before the new-session branch picker lists
  them. The store's `branches` map (path → current branch) is re-read by
  `refreshBranches` → `current_branches` not only on the top-level repo set changing and
  after app-initiated checkouts, but also on each session's **busy→idle edge**
  (debounced ~600ms, #212 — mirroring the #97 title reader's cadence), so an
  **in-terminal `git checkout`** (incl. inside a worktree) updates the sidebar's
  branch/worktree label by the next idle settle without an app restart.
- **File-tree git status (#252):** the **FileTree** (`components/FileTree`) tints each
  row by its working-tree state vs `HEAD` — file names/icons **green** for new
  (`A`/untracked), **yellow** for edited (`M`); folder names roll up to their
  highest-severity descendant (red > yellow > green) so a collapsed/vanished subtree
  still flags a change; a **deleted** file shows a red, struck-through, non-openable
  **ghost row** in its (still-rendered) parent plus the red ancestor roll-up. Backed by
  a **lightweight** `file_statuses(repo)` read — one `git -c core.quotepath=false status
  --porcelain=v1 -z --untracked-files=all` (no hunk parse, unlike `working_diff`; a
  rename surfaces as add(new)+del(old)), bounded + fail-open (non-git/clean → empty).
  The store's `fileStatuses` map (repoPath → { repo-relative POSIX path → `A`/`M`/`D` })
  is filled once-per-repo by `refreshFileStatuses` — on app load + repo-set change, on
  the same debounced **busy→idle** edge as the branch refresh (#212), after
  app-initiated checkout/branch-create writes, and from the FileTree's **Refresh**
  button / mount. Pure roll-up + deleted-children helpers in `FileTree/fileStatus.ts`.
  Coloring uses only the on-system `--status-done/-awaiting/-error` tokens, so it's
  identical on macOS and Windows (the only OS-sensitive primitive is the `git`
  shell-out, which goes through the shared `hidden_command` console-flash guard).
- **OS files → file tree (#253):** dragging files/folders from Finder/Explorer onto a
  FileTree **folder row** (or the tree **root**) **moves** them into that directory.
  Tauri's webview drag-drop event is **window-global** (not DOM-bound), so `src/
  osFileDrop.ts` (`useOsFileDrop`, wired from both `App.tsx` and the detached
  `CanvasWindow` — each its own webview) listens via `getCurrentWebview().
  onDragDropEvent` and **hit-tests** the cursor: physical→CSS px via `devicePixelRatio`
  (Retina + Windows fractional scaling), `document.elementFromPoint` →
  `closest("[data-filetree-droptarget]")`/`[data-filetree-repo]` (pure
  `resolveDropTarget`) resolves the repo + dir (a folder row → its path, a file row →
  its parent dir, the root container → `""`). On `over` the store's transient
  `fileDropTarget` highlights the exact target (token-only `.dropTarget`); on `drop`
  `moveFilesIntoRepo` calls `move_into_repo` per path, bumps a per-repo `fileTreeRefresh`
  signal (each tree reloads its visible levels — no reset), and toasts the result. The
  in-app **dnd-kit** drags (pointer events) are a separate input stream that never
  clashes with the OS drag.
- **Views:** the store holds `sessions / selectedId / view / recents / branches /
  canvases / activeCanvasId / claudeMissing / toasts / schedules / settings /
  sidebarWidth / folderOrder`; the app mounts one of
  **Overview or Canvas** (#46/#75 — Focus was removed). Each session's xterm is owned
  by a **persistent terminal
  pool** (`Terminal/terminalPool.ts`), created once and **reparented** into the
  active view's slot (parked off-screen otherwise) — so a view switch never
  disposes/recreates the terminal or replays scrollback (which would garble
  `claude`'s width-specific TUI redraw). Scrollback replays once at creation;
  resizes are debounced + applied only while visible. The pool's `createHost`
  **linkifies `http`/`https` URLs** (a `WebLinksAddon`) so a **⌘-click** opens the
  default browser via the dependency-free Rust `open_url` (http/https only, so no
  shell-injection vector even where the opener is `cmd`) — for both agent and shell
  terminals (#109). `open_url` is **cross-platform** (#217): macOS `open`, Windows
  `cmd /C start "" <url>`, else `xdg-open` — so the same path (and the #210 feedback
  button) opens the browser on Windows too, not a File Explorer folder.
- **Overview customization:** columns are grouped by repo (#36) — by a session's
  pure **`effectiveRepo`** (`paths.ts`), so a worktree agent (#74) sits in its
  **parent repo's** cluster sharing its color, text-badged "worktree" rather than
  reading as a foreign-colored stray (#96). On an Overview card / Canvas panel
  **header**, a worktree agent uses the **same** `OpenViewButton` (the views /
  new-session popover, scoped to its worktree folder) as a normal agent, and
  "worktree" is a **static, non-clickable badge** styled like the "fork" badge (#213
  — superseding the earlier clickable `WorktreeViewsBadge`, now removed). Per repo, a
  user-managed list of extra panels (diff #39 / markdown #41 / terminal #72) follows the agent
  terminals, and the whole cluster is **drag-reorderable within the repo** (#43,
  dnd-kit) — each column is a sortable keyed by session/panel id, so a reorder
  reparents DOM nodes and never remounts a terminal (pool intact). Persisted per
  repo: `overview_panels` (panel defs) + `overview_order` (the unified item
  order, merged with live items so spawn/exit don't scramble it).
- **Sidebar tree (#45/#59):** each repo lists its sessions **and** its non-agent
  items — the **same `overview_panels` Overview shows, 1:1**: file viewers, diff
  viewers, shell terminals (#72), and scheduled sessions (#94). #59 folded the old per-repo `open_files` into
  `overview_panels`, so an item opened anywhere (the searchable file picker #56, or the
  repo menu's **Views** section #82) appears in both places (that legacy fold-in is now
  **one-shot** — boot clears `open_files` instead of re-folding it, so a closed viewer
  never resurrects, #110). A tree row click
  **selects/jumps to the item in the current view** (#79 — never auto-switching
  Overview↔Canvas); the hover × removes the item (and its Overview column); every row
  (session / file / diff / terminal / kanban) is a dnd-kit **draggable source** that drops
  into the active Canvas (#47/#59 — agents → terminal, files → file viewer, diffs → diff
  panel; new item types are draggable by default via a `payloadToContent` case). Every
  row also has a **right-click context menu**: the agent row offers **Rename** /
  **Fork conversation** (dimmed + tooltip when the source has no history, #138) / **Copy
  session ID** / **Remove** (#57/#131); a **worktree header** offers **Reveal in Finder**
  / **Copy absolute path** (#133); and the file/diff/terminal/scheduled rows a single
  **Remove** (or **Cancel** for a schedule) item — all via a shared `RowContextMenu`
  (#132). The
  repo's context menu (#54) offers **New session** (which — like the inline per-repo
  **+** — runs `startRepoSession` (#127), **skipping the folder step**: a git folder
  opens the modal straight at the branch step, a non-git folder spawns with no modal;
  the global ⌘N / button keeps the folder step), a **Views** section to add
  file/diff/terminal/**kanban-board** panels (#82/#145; the single "Kanban board" entry
  opens a `.md`-scoped `FilePicker` with an in-picker create-or-open flow #151),
  non-destructive **Reveal in Finder** / **Copy path**
  utilities (#130 — `reveal_path` shells out to macOS `open`, no shell) + a **Pull**
  item (#181 — `git pull --ff-only` on the folder's current branch, toasted; shown
  only when a current branch is known; mirrored in the worktree header menu), repo
  color (#35), and destructive actions —
  **Kill all agents** / **Close all items** (#91) and **Forget folder** (#31), the
  latter two also tearing down the folder's non-agent items (killing their PTYs) and
  pending schedules (#106); each destructive step is confirm-gated unless turned off
  in Settings (#103). Each repo header carries a **static, non-interactive
  repo-colored folder** marker (the Lucide `Folder` icon, tinted via `repoColor`, #128)
  before the repo name, occupying the activity-dot slot (#95); the name still filters
  Overview (#34). _(#113 made folders collapsible with a repo-colored disclosure
  triangle + a persisted `collapsed_repos`; **#115 reverted that** at the user's
  request — folders are non-collapsible again, all child rows always render, and the
  triangle became a cube, which **#128** then swapped for the folder icon.)_ Every
  tree-row label renders at a uniform compact 10px (`--fs-meta-xs`, #111).
- **Canvas (#46/#47/#58):** a third view — **multiple named tabs** (#58), each its
  own recursive **BSP split-panel** layout (a binary tree `split{dir,a,b,sizes}` /
  `leaf{id,content}`; pure ops in `Canvas/canvasTree.ts`). The tabs (`canvases` =
  `{id,name,layout}[]` + `activeCanvasId`) persist as one opaque `canvases` JSON blob
  (migrated once from the old single `canvas_layout`); the `CanvasTabs` strip adds
  (+), closes (always keeps ≥1), inline-renames, and drag-reorders tabs via a nested
  dnd-kit context. Panels host **real content** (#47): agent terminals (#18 pool),
  file viewers (#44), diff viewers (#39), shell terminals (#72), and **kanban boards**
  (#145) — a `content` descriptor `{kind, ...refs}`
  resolved at render. **Drag-in:** one **app-level dnd-kit context** (`App.tsx`)
  spans the sidebar (drag sources: sessions, files, diffs #59) and Canvas (center +
  edge drop zones); `Canvas/canvasDrop.ts` maps payloads → content and applies the
  split/append **to the active tab**. Dropping on an edge splits recursively, borders
  resize via **react-resizable-panels**, panels close. An **existing** panel can also be
  **moved/reordered** by dragging its header onto another panel's edge (#135 `moveLeaf` —
  remove + re-split **reusing the leaf's id + content**, so the pooled terminal reparents,
  applied atomically on drop; the **whole header bar** is the grip #144, and a long title
  truncates with an ellipsis #146). Closing a tab that **has contents** prompts **Kill /
  Keep / Cancel** via the `CanvasCloseModal` (#137 — Kill tears down the tab's leaves;
  default configurable in Settings → Behavior). The Overview wall and the tab
  strip keep their own nested sortable contexts (#43/#58) — only one view mounts at a
  time, so targets never clash.
- **Canvas templates (#117/#118):** reusable saved Canvas layouts whose leaves hold
  inert action **blocks** (`new-agent` w/ optional prompt + optional custom **name** #136,
  `new-terminal`, `open-file` w/ a relative path, `open-diff`) instead of live content. A
  single **block registry**
  (`Canvas/templateBlocks.ts`, mirroring #82) drives the placeable set — a new content
  kind becomes a block with one entry. The `CanvasTabs` strip's **▾ Templates menu**
  opens a full-screen **`TemplateEditor`** (reuses the BSP surface + `canvasTree` ops:
  a block **palette** is the only drag source, drop into center/edges to split, resize,
  configure each block inline, name + save), a **`TemplateManager`** modal (edit /
  inline-rename / duplicate / delete, Delete confirm-gated #103), and (#118) **"New tab
  from template…"** → a **`TemplateUseModal`** (pick template → pick one folder, reusing
  the #66 folder UX). Templates persist in their **own** `canvas_templates` Rust blob
  (`get_canvas_templates`/`set_canvas_templates`, separate from `canvases`) → store
  `canvasTemplates` + `saveTemplate`/`renameTemplate`/`duplicateTemplate`/`deleteTemplate`.
  A `CanvasTemplate` reuses the `CanvasNode` tree with block-kind leaf `content`.
  **Instantiation (#118):** `useTemplate(id, cwd)` opens a **new tab** (pure
  `templateInstantiate.ts` maps the tree → leaves flagged `kind:"pending"` carrying the
  source `block` + chosen folder, fresh ids), then `resolveTemplateBlock` runs each
  block **independently, best-effort** against that folder — `new-agent` via the
  prompt-seeded spawn (`spawn_session` now takes an optional `prompt`, #93/#101),
  `new-terminal` a fresh shell, `open-file` gated by `file_exists`, `open-diff` by
  `is_git_repo`. A failed panel stays `pending` with an **inline error + Retry** (never
  a toast/silent skip), `open-file` also offering **Pick file** (`FilePicker` scoped to
  the folder); the panel **retains its block** so Retry re-runs it in place. No
  spawn-count guard ("just do it"). The reconcile (`App.tsx`) now also keeps PTYs
  referenced only by a Canvas layout (`sessionIdsInLayout`) so template terminals
  survive. Instantiating a template into a **sole empty canvas** replaces that tab in
  place rather than leaving an empty tab behind (#142); 2+ tabs, or a tab with panels,
  still append.
- **File editing & Kanban board (#141/#143/#145/#147/#148/#149/#150/#151):** the
  universal `FileViewer` (#40/#44) renders markdown and highlights code (Prism); its
  **raw markdown / plain-text** view is **editable + auto-saving** via the shared
  `useAutoSaveFile(repoPath, file, active)` hook (`src/useAutoSaveFile.ts` — read +
  hot-reload poll + debounced `writeTextFile` + a dirty/focus reconcile that pauses the
  poll while editing + IME-safe + a "Saving…/Saved" status), while rendered markdown, the
  Prism **code** view, and large files stay read-only (#148). In **rendered** markdown a
  ` ```mermaid ` fenced block renders as a **Mermaid SVG diagram** (#254): an **opt-in**
  react-markdown `code` override (`MermaidCode`, wired only at the FileViewer call site —
  so Kanban/PatchNotes/Settings markdown are unaffected) renders `MermaidBlock`, which
  **lazy-loads** mermaid (its own async chunk — diagram-free files never pull it) and
  one-time-initializes it (`theme:"dark"`, `securityLevel:"strict"` DOMPurify-sanitized,
  a system/sans `fontFamily` so nothing is fetched — **bundled/offline**). An invalid
  diagram falls back to the original code block + a muted error note, never crashing; the
  Raw view shows the fence as text. Pure helpers (`isMermaidClassName`/`renderMermaidSvg`)
  live in `components/FileViewer/mermaid.ts`. Pure WebView SVG, so identical on macOS and
  Windows (no native/path/shell code). A **markdown Kanban board**
  is a first-class content kind (`kind:"kanban"`, reusing the `file` panel's refs +
  `overview_panels`, no new blob): the pure `parseBoard`/`serializeBoard` engine
  (`components/Kanban/kanban.ts`, **Obsidian-Kanban** format — `## column` + `- [ ] card`,
  frontmatter + `**Complete**` + `%% kanban:settings %%` preserved verbatim) round-trips
  the `.md`, and the `KanbanPanel` renders columns + cards (markdown bodies, horizontal
  scroll, hot-reload) **fully editable** — add/edit/delete/reorder cards (nested dnd-kit;
  dragging a card between lanes = status change), column ops, and a **Board/Raw** toggle
  (#147, Raw editable #149) — every mutation and the Raw textarea routed through the **same**
  `useAutoSaveFile` buffer and written back via `write_text_file` (#141, the app's first
  arbitrary file write). Opened from the repo **Views** menu's single "Kanban board" entry
  with an in-picker **create-or-open** flow (#151), a draggable sidebar row, an Overview
  column, and a Canvas panel.
- **Detached canvas windows (#84):** a Canvas tab can open in its **own native
  window** for multi-monitor use, via a **pop-out button** on the tab or a **drag
  tear-off** (drag a tab out of the strip). The button/tear-off call Rust
  `open_canvas_window(id,title)`, which creates a `WebviewWindow` labelled
  `canvas-<id>` loading the **canvas-only route** `index.html?canvas=<id>`
  (`windowContext.ts` reads the param → `IS_MAIN_WINDOW` / `WINDOW_LABEL`;
  `CanvasWindow` renders the shared `Canvas/CanvasSurface` with no sidebar/Overview/
  tabs). Each window is its **own document** — its own store, `outputBus`, and #18
  terminal pool — and Tauri session events are **global**, so a detached window's
  pool renders the same backend PTYs. **One PTY renders in one window at a time**
  (the #18 width constraint): the pure `computeSessionOwners(canvases, detachedIds)`
  assigns each session to exactly one window (a detached canvas claims its sessions,
  else `"main"`); Overview cards + Canvas panels show a **`DetachedNote`** ("running
  in a separate window" + Focus) instead of a terminal when another window owns it,
  and each window's `reconcileTerminals` keeps only owned PTYs (dispose-in-one /
  create-in-the-other, reversed on re-dock). **Cross-window sync:** `set_canvases`
  persists then broadcasts `canvas://changed` (the **main** window is authoritative
  for `activeId`; a detached window's write merges only the `canvases` array);
  opening/closing a window broadcasts `canvas://windows` (the detached id set). The
  main tab strip marks detached tabs ("in window"), ⌘1–9 (#76) and a detached-tab
  click **`focus_canvas_window`** (raise) instead of switching, and **closing a
  detached window re-docks** its canvas (its `Destroyed` handler re-broadcasts the
  set; the main window reclaims the PTYs). Detached windows are **per-session** — not
  restored on relaunch (capability `canvas-*` in `capabilities/default.json`).
- **Scheduled sessions (#93/#94/#125):** an agent can be **scheduled to launch later**.
  The **"+ Schedule session"** sidebar button / **⌘⇧N** opens the new-session modal
  in **schedule mode** — folder → branch (incl. **"+ add branch"** to create a new
  branch *at fire time*, #125) → a final step for **launch time** (a
  `datetime-local`), optional **prompt**, optional **name** — and calls
  `create_schedule`. Records persist in `store.rs` (`schedules: ScheduledSession[]`,
  carrying a `create_branch` flag + `branch_base` for the new-branch intent, #125).
  A **poll loop** in `lib.rs` (every `SCHEDULE_POLL_SECS`) calls
  `commands::fire_due_schedules`, which atomically `take_due_schedules(now)`, then
  (best-effort) **creates** the new branch (`git checkout -b`, #124/#125) or checks
  out the existing one, spawns `claude` **pre-seeded with the prompt** (the
  positional invocation, see Conventions), converts the record into a live session,
  and emits **`schedule://fired`** (→ the main window moves it scheduled→live). On
  boot the first tick fires anything **missed while closed** (catch-up). One-shot
  only (local clock). **#94** makes a schedule a first-class **draggable item type**:
  a `CanvasContent` **`kind: "scheduled"`** (+ a `payloadToContent` case) renders the
  shared **`ScheduledPanel`** — an **auto-saving** (debounced → `update_schedule`)
  editor for the launch time / name / prompt + cancel — in the **sidebar** (a
  draggable row, click selects/jumps #79, × cancels), an **Overview card**, and a
  **Canvas panel**. Time helpers live in `src/time.ts`. The schedule **prompt** field
  (in both the `NewSessionModal` schedule step and the `ScheduledPanel`) is a shared
  **`SkillAutocomplete`** component (#114): typing `/` in command position opens a
  dropdown of the slash-invokable **skills** `claude` would offer, read best-effort by
  the Rust **`skills.rs`** (`list_skills(cwd)`) from project (`<cwd>/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
  + `.claude/commands/**/*.md`) and user (`~/.claude/…`) dirs, deduped (project shadows
  user); ↑/↓/Enter/Tab insert `/<skill-name> ` (with a container-key guard so Enter/Escape
  drive the menu, not the modal). Plugin/marketplace skills are out of scope.
- **Auto-named agents (#97):** an agent with **no custom name** shows **claude's own
  session title** rather than the bare branch. A backend **title reader**
  (`src-tauri/src/title.rs`) globs the session's `~/.claude/projects/*/<uuid>.jsonl`
  log by UUID and takes the latest `ai-title` (fallback: the first `last-prompt`,
  else the branch); a dedicated **title-worker** thread re-reads it on each
  busy→idle edge (off the monitor's hot path), emitting `SessionEvent::Name` →
  `session://name`, which `lib.rs` persists (the `auto_name` field) and forwards.
  `sessionLabel` (`paths.ts`) resolves **`custom || auto || branch`**, so the title
  fills the single-line label (#95) everywhere — a user rename (#57) still wins.
  Best-effort: a missing / unreadable / format-changed log degrades to the branch,
  and the busy indicator is never stalled. The Settings auto-name toggle (#100) gates
  it.
- **Settings (#100/#102/#103/#107/#119):** a sidebar **footer gear** opens a centered,
  focus-trapped **Settings modal** (`components/Settings`) — a **fixed 720×600** size
  (clamped to 90vh, #119) so every section renders identically and a tall section
  scrolls inside the content pane (the nav + action row stay put) — with five sections —
  **Terminal** (font size / line height via the custom **`Slider`** #122 + cursor
  blink → the live pooled xterms via `terminalPool.applyTerminalSettings`),
  **Sessions** (the #97 auto-name toggle + the #142 **Coding agent** selector →
  `defaultAgent`, now claude / codex / **opencode** with an inline "untested" caution
  for the non-claude picks),
  **Appearance** (an accent swatch over the Catppuccin palette + a reduce-motion
  toggle), **Behavior** (default launch view + confirm-destructive gating #103 + the
  Canvas tab-close default `canvasCloseBehavior`: Ask / Always kill / Never kill #137),
  and **Data & About** (open data folder, clear recents, app + `claude` versions). A
  modal-local **draft** applies only on **Save** via `applySettingsEffects` (accent
  overrides `--accent` plus its companions `--accent-hover/-dim/-fg` through
  `accentCompanions` #107; reduce-motion toggles `body.reduce-motion`). Settings
  persist as an opaque `settings` blob (`get_settings` / `set_settings`) merged over
  TS-side `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, so an older `sessions.json` upgrades cleanly.
- **Pluggable coding agent (#101):** an `AgentSpec` catalog
  (`src-tauri/src/agents.rs`) is the single source of truth for each agent's binary +
  how it spawns / resumes / seeds a session; the **`claude`** spec preserves today's
  exact flags. Each session and schedule **records its own `agent`** (serde-default
  `"claude"`), and `pty.rs` (`spawn_session` / `spawn_session_with_prompt` /
  `resume_session`) resolves the spec instead of hardcoding `"claude"`. **#141** adds the
  **`codex`** spec + its backend capability gating: Codex owns its own session identity
  (`codex [PROMPT]`, **no** `--session-id`), and `supports_resume` / `supports_auto_name`
  are `false`, so the boot-resume loop / Restart / Fork (typed `ResumeUnsupported`) and the
  #97/#138 title+forkable globs are all gated off for Codex (a per-session `uses_claude_log`
  flag, carried in the monitor's title-worker poke, skips the glob — Codex reports
  `forkable: false`, falls back to the branch label). An `agent_info(agent)` command exposes
  each spec's binary / install-hint / capabilities + a live `--version` presence check.
  **Claude behaves byte-for-byte as before.** **#142** surfaces the choice: a **Coding
  agent** selector in Settings → Sessions persists a `defaultAgent` that every new-session
  spawn path threads through (global / per-repo #127 / worktree #74 / scheduled #93 /
  template `new-agent` #118; a Fork inherits the *source's* agent). A TS capability mirror
  (`src/agents.ts`) gates the UI: Fork is disabled with a Codex-specific tooltip
  (`forkUnavailableReason`, `paths.ts`), copy-resume / Copy-session-ID are hidden for a
  non-resumable agent, and `ClaudeMissing` reads the selected agent's `agent_info` to name
  the right CLI + install hint. Selecting Claude leaves everything exactly as before.
  A later task adds the **`opencode`** spec — a third, **untested** agent. Like Codex it
  owns its own session identity (no app `--session-id`), so resume/fork/auto-name are
  gated off (`uses_claude_log=false`, `forkable:false`). OpenCode's bare positional is a
  **project directory**, not a prompt, so a seeded launch passes the prompt via
  `opencode --prompt "<text>"` (best-effort — **verify against the installed `opencode`
  CLI**); an interactive session is the bare TUI in cwd. The **five-hour usage bar**
  (#154) is Claude-only: `isClaudeActive` now hides it whenever **any** non-claude
  (codex *or* opencode) session is active.
- **First-launch agent picker:** on boot (main window only) `maybeOnboardAgent` runs once
  — gated by a new `onboarded` flag in the settings blob (defaults `false`, so an existing
  install also runs the one-time check on its next launch; preserved across "Reset to
  defaults"). It presence-checks each `SELECTABLE_AGENTS` CLI via `agent_info`
  (`version === null` ⇒ missing): **0 installed** → no-op (re-checks next launch; the
  `ClaudeMissing` screen guides install); **exactly 1** → silently set it as
  `defaultAgent` (+ an "untested" toast if it's codex/opencode); **2+** → open the
  `OnboardingModal` (`components/Onboarding`) to pick — Claude badged "Recommended",
  codex/opencode "Untested", Escape/scrim keeps the current default. Picking / dismissing
  sets `onboarded` so it never re-prompts.
- **Resizable sidebar (#108):** a thin right-edge drag handle sets the sidebar width,
  clamped to **[180, 560]** (default 260) and **persisted** via a dedicated Rust
  `sidebar_width` value (`get_sidebar_width` / `set_sidebar_width`), kept **separate**
  from the Settings blob so the modal draft can't clobber a drag. Main-window only.
- **Reorderable folders (#211):** the top-level repo "folders" are **drag-reorderable**
  — there's **no separate handle**; the whole repo header is the grip (a `useSortable`
  whose `attributes`/`listeners` sit on the `repoHeader`), while the 4px pointer
  activation distance lets a plain click on the title (filter Overview) / `+` (new
  session) / right-click (repo menu) still work. The group is extracted into a
  **`RepoGroup`** component and the list wrapped in a `SortableContext`
  (`verticalListSortingStrategy`) that is a **descendant of the app-level `DndContext`**
  (App.tsx) — never a nested one, which would rebind the sidebar's row drag sources and
  break drag-into-Canvas; App.tsx's `onDragEnd` detects the `repohead:` drag id and
  calls `reorderRepos(arrayMove(...))`. The order **persists** via a dedicated Rust
  `repo_order: Vec<String>` value (`get_repo_order` / `set_repo_order`), kept separate
  from the Settings blob like `sidebar_width`; the displayed order is `mergeRepoOrder(
  folderOrder, repoOrder(...))` so a spawned/added repo appends and a forgotten one
  drops without scrambling the rest. The collapsed rail renders the same persisted
  order (no drag there — out of scope). Main-window only.

> **Cross-platform builds (#139/#140/#143).** The project builds, tests, **and runs** on

> cross-platform `home_dir()` (`USERPROFILE`), and `claude.cmd` resolution via `PATHEXT` +
> launch through `cmd.exe /C`. **#143** finished it: a platform-neutral bundle description

> schedule-step **Worktree ⌘⏎** button, and the #206 **New tab ⌘T** add-button hint + menu kbd).
> New keyboard *handling* stays `metaKey || ctrlKey`, so a Ctrl shortcut fires on Windows for

> platform-cfg — macOS `open`, **Windows `cmd /C start "" <url>`**, else `xdg-open` — *not*
> `os_open`/`explorer.exe`: `explorer.exe <url>` opened a File Explorer window instead of the
> browser, so the #210 sidebar **feedback button** (and the #109 ⌘/Ctrl-click link path) now
> reach the browser on Windows. `os_open` (`explorer.exe`) still backs the **folder** opens
> (`reveal_path`/`open_data_folder`). User-facing copy that names the platform (the #208

> **Rebased `main` features #211–#217 + the usage bar (#154).** #211 (drag-reorder sidebar

> The **#154 five-hour usage bar** needed Windows work: `usage.rs` reads the OAuth token from
> `~/.claude/.credentials.json` via the cross-platform **`home_dir()`** (`%USERPROFILE%` on

> was authored on `main`; the rebase keeps it and drops the port's earlier `os_open` URL route.

## v1 scope decisions / out of scope

- **Git is read-mostly, with a small set of deliberate writes** — ReCue reads
  git (current branch + working-tree diff vs `HEAD`) and never commits. Its writes
  are: (1) **`git checkout <existing branch>`** from the new-session panel
  (#27/#53/#61) — picking a branch checks it out (in the chosen folder, only an
  existing local branch, validated backend-side) before the agent starts, warning
  before disrupting another agent already running in that folder; (2) **`git worktree
  add` / `git worktree remove`** for isolated worktree agents (#74) — **⌘⏎** in the
  branch step starts an agent in an app-managed worktree
  (`<app-data>/worktrees/<repo-id>/<branch>`), shown nested under its parent repo in
  the sidebar; the worktree is removed (ref-counted) only when its last agent goes,
  and a dirty worktree is kept rather than force-deleted; and (3) **branch creation**
  (#124, expanding the earlier "never creates branches" rule) — the branch step's
  **"+ add branch"** option creates + checks out a new branch (`git checkout -b
  <name> [<base>]`, base defaulting to the current branch/HEAD) and starts a normal
  agent, or with **⌘⏎** creates it as a worktree (`git worktree add -b`); the name is
  validated backend-side (a valid ref that must not already exist) with an inline
  error, and the destructive-checkout warning still applies to the in-folder path.
  The reads now also include one **network** read — (4) **`git fetch --prune`**
  (#180): opening the new-session branch step auto-fetches (best-effort,
  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so a private remote can't hang the modal) so the picker can
  list **remote branches** under a "Remote branches" header (deduped vs local,
  `*/HEAD` excluded). Selecting a remote branch **pulls it locally** by **reusing the
  #124 create-branch write** — a new local tracking branch named `<short>` based on
  `<remote-ref>` (`git checkout -b` in-folder, or `git worktree add -b` on **⌘⏎**),
  with `validate_new_branch` widened to accept a remote-tracking ref as the base. No
  new pull/checkout command, and no commits. Finally, (5) **`git pull --ff-only`**
  (#181, `pull_branch`/`git::pull_ff`) — a **Pull** item in the sidebar **repo** and
  **worktree** context menus fast-forwards that folder's current branch to its
  upstream (same `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` network guard), toasting git's summary or its
  error. `--ff-only` only ever fast-forwards (never a merge commit / partial-merge
  state in a folder an agent may be using); a diverged or upstream-less branch fails
  cleanly with an error toast. No confirm gate; still no commits / push.
- **File access is read-mostly, with two deliberate writes** — `files.rs` lists +
  reads repo text files for the viewer (#40/#44) and writes the repo: since **#141**
  `write_text_file` (the app's **first arbitrary file write**, backing the markdown
  **Kanban board** #141–#151 and the FileViewer's **editable raw markdown / plain-text**
  view #148/#149), and since **#253** `move_into_repo` — the **second** write — which
  **moves a dragged OS file/directory into** a repo folder (drag-from-Finder/Explorer
  onto the file tree). The move confines only the **destination** to the repo (the
  source is the user's dragged OS path — explicit consent, like the #163 native dialog),
  refuses a name collision (no overwrite), and is data-safe (same-volume `fs::rename`,
  else cross-volume recursive copy **then** remove — a failure never loses the source);
  no shell-out, so it behaves identically on macOS/Windows. **File listing scales to any repo, all
  files:** the old recursive `list_files` (a flat list **capped at 500 / depth 8**,
  walked in unsorted filesystem order — so a large repo's files, incl. user-created
  ones like a Kanban `.md`, were silently truncated, and *which* ones differed per
  machine) is replaced by two bounded commands. The **lazy file tree** (#167) calls
  **`list_dir(repo, subdir)`** for one directory level at a time (folders first then
  viewable files), fetched on each folder's first expand — **no count or depth cap**
  (deep trees are reached by expanding), so it works for huge repos. The **file
  picker** (#56) calls **`search_files(repo, query, ext?, limit)`** — a
  **deterministic** (sorted-walk, machine-independent) case-insensitive substring
  search over repo-relative paths, optional extension filter (`.md` for Kanban), with
  a **result** cap (`SEARCH_RESULT_CAP`, 500) the user narrows by typing, so the IPC
  payload + render stay bounded on arbitrarily large repos. Both still skip heavy/dep
  dirs **and now `.git`** (`SKIP_DIRS` — narrowing #179's all-dot-folders listing, so
  `.git` internals no longer flood / crowd out real files; `.claude`/`.github`/… stay
  listed) and binary extensions (`SKIP_EXTS`). The write is path-validated
  exactly like `read_text_file` (canonicalize, confine to the repo, reject
  `..`/symlink/out-of-repo targets; a new file's parent dir must exist + be inside
  the repo), narrowing the earlier "no arbitrary file writes" rule the way #74/#124
  narrowed the git rule. The viewer can also **open any file on disk** (#163) via the
  file-switcher's **Browse…** (the native open dialog → `pickFile`): an absolute
  `/a/b/c.md` is addressed as `{ repoPath: "/a/b", file: "c.md" }` (its own parent
  dir as the root), so every read/write stays **confined to that file's directory**
  with **no `files.rs` change** — the native dialog is the user's explicit consent.
  An out-of-repo file opened as an **Overview** item groups under a repo named for
  its parent dir (grouping is by `effectiveRepo`); in a **Canvas** panel there's no
  grouping.
- No app-rendered approval UI — users answer prompts directly in the terminal.
  (The v1 "no status system" rule was deliberately narrowed by **#42** — a single
  **busy/idle** indicator — and by **#112**, which adds a third "finished / needs
  input" yellow state to that same dot. Still no approval pills or floating status.)
- No Archive (single **Remove = kill + forget**), no Skills manager, no light mode,
  no auth. **Fork now exists** (#126 — reverses the v1 "no Fork" rule): a "Fork
  conversation" button on every agent header branches the source agent into a new
  parallel session (see the Spawn note + Conventions).
- **Settings** now exists (#100/#102/#103 — reverses the v1 "no settings screen"
  rule, as #84 reversed single-window): a sidebar footer gear opens a modal with
  Terminal / Sessions / Appearance / Behavior / Data & About sections (see the
  architecture note). Still no light mode and no per-session config beyond these.
- **Multi-window** is now supported for **Canvas tabs only** (#84 — reverses the v1
  single-window rule): a canvas can open in its own native window (pop-out button +
  drag tear-off) for multi-monitor use. Detached windows are **per-session** (not
  restored on relaunch); Overview and individual panels do **not** pop out, and a
  single PTY is never shown in two windows at once (see the architecture note).
- **macOS code signing + Hardened Runtime + entitlements now exist — for permissions**
  (#292 — narrows the earlier "no code signing / notarization" rule, the way #74/#124
  narrowed the git rule and #84/#100/#126 reversed single-window/settings/fork). The old
  rule was the direct cause of a bug: voice/mic and protected-folder (Downloads/Documents/
  Desktop) prompts asked ~5× and never worked, because macOS **TCC** pins a grant to the
  app's **code signature**, and an unsigned/ad-hoc app has no stable one (so every launch
  looks new), while the mic also needs the **`com.apple.security.device.audio-input`**
  entitlement present in the signature under the **Hardened Runtime** —
  `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` alone is not enough. The fix is **macOS-bundle-only** (no
  runtime Rust/TS/CSS): a new **`src-tauri/Entitlements.plist`** (audio-input +
  `cs.disable-library-validation`; **no App Sandbox**) wired via
  `tauri.conf.json` `bundle.macOS.entitlements` (Tauri applies `--options runtime`),
  four protected-folder `NS*FolderUsageDescription` strings added to `Info.plist`, a
  documented **`scripts/sign-macos-local.sh`** (self-signed/ad-hoc local re-sign — **works
  today, no Apple account**), and a **guarded** Developer-ID sign+notarize path in the
  macOS leg of `release.yml` (**provisioned but dormant** until the maintainer adds a
  Developer ID cert + the `APPLE_*` secrets; absent → today's ad-hoc fallback, build still
  succeeds). Windows/Linux untouched. Full walkthrough + recovery
  (`tccutil reset Microphone com.recue.app`) in **`docs/macos-permissions.md`**. Still no
  App Sandbox and (until the secrets are added) no notarization — a from-scratch unsigned
  local build still warns at Gatekeeper.

## Conventions

- Keep the frontend/backend boundary clean: the backend exposes typed Tauri
  commands/events; the frontend wraps them in a typed IPC layer.
- Keep terminal byte streams out of React state — xterm.js consumes them directly
  to avoid re-render storms.
- **Sessions & resume:** each session is a `claude` PTY. New sessions are spawned
  as `claude --session-id <uuid>` (we own the id); on boot they resume via
  `claude --resume <uuid>`. **These flags are verified** against the real CLI
  (claude 2.1.x, #30): the id round-trips, and `--resume` of an unknown id exits 1
  ("No conversation found"). On boot, persisted sessions show a neutral
  **"reconnecting"** state (not an error) until their first output / a real exit;
  a failed resume shows that one terminal's exit overlay + Restart, not a toast
  wall. Session metadata + recent dirs persist to `sessions.json` in the app-data
  dir (`store.rs`). `Remove` = kill + delete the record. A **scheduled** session
  (#93) additionally boots with an **initial prompt** passed **positionally**:
  `claude --session-id <uuid> "<prompt>"` (`pty.rs spawn_session_with_prompt`). This
  is **verified** against the real CLI (claude 2.1.x): `claude --help` documents
  `claude [options] [command] [prompt]` — a positional prompt that starts the
  interactive session with it sent. If a future `claude` version changes these
  flags, update `pty.rs` (`spawn_session` / `spawn_session_with_prompt` /
  `resume_session` / `fork_session`) and note it here. Since **#101** these
  spawn/resume paths resolve a pluggable **`AgentSpec`** (`agents.rs`) keyed by each
  record's stored `agent` (serde-default `"claude"`) rather than hardcoding the binary.
  The catalog also holds **`codex`** (#141) and **`opencode`** — both **untested**; the
  same **verify-against-the-installed-CLI** discipline applies to each spec's flags as to
  claude's. OpenCode owns its own session identity (no `--session-id`) and a bare
  positional is a project directory, so its `spawn_args` seeds a prompt via
  `opencode --prompt "<text>"` (best-effort, flagged in-code for real-CLI verification),
  else the bare `opencode` TUI; resume/fork/auto-name are gated off like Codex. A **fork** (#126)
  branches a source agent's conversation into a **new parallel session**:
  `claude --session-id <new> --resume <source> --fork-session` (`AgentSpec::fork_args`
  / `pty.rs fork_session` / the `fork_session` command), **verified** against claude
  2.1.176 (all three flags parse together; the source's on-disk log is read at spawn
  time, leaving the source untouched). The fork is a normal tracked session with its
  own app-owned UUID + a serde-default `forked_from` (provenance + the "fork" badge),
  spawned non-seeded like a resume (so it stays gray until first input, #116). A
  **guard refuses to fork a source with no on-disk conversation log** (#134 — `title::
  has_conversation` checks `~/.claude/projects/*/<uuid>.jsonl` for ≥1 real turn, fail-open;
  returns a typed `NothingToFork` error instead of spawning a doomed code-1 panel), and a
  persisted `forkable` flag (emitted on the #97 title-worker cadence) renders the Fork
  affordance **unavailable up front** at all three sites (#138).
- **Exit handling (#63):** the discriminator is the exit code (`store.ts`
  `onExited` / the pure `isCleanExit`). A **clean exit — `claude` exits code 0
  while running** (the user ended the agent) is forgotten like _Remove_:
  `forgetExitedSession` drops it from the store (its pooled xterm is disposed by
  `reconcileTerminals`) **and** its persisted record (so it doesn't return on next
  boot), with a brief "Agent exited" toast — no overlay, no Restart. **Any other
  exit** (non-zero/crash, or a failed boot resume) keeps the session with its
  `exitedCode`, so `Terminal.tsx` shows the "Process exited (code N)" overlay +
  Restart. **Restart** (`restartSession` → `resume_session`) spawns a fresh PTY
  under the same id; on success the Terminal calls `terminalPool.resetTerminal`
  to dispose + recreate the pooled xterm so the relaunched TUI repaints cleanly
  instead of appending onto the dead session's screen. The boot window is guarded
  (`booting`): a code-0 exit there keeps the overlay rather than auto-forgetting,
  and **app shutdown keeps records** (`kill_all` doesn't delete them) so they
  auto-resume on next boot (#30) — the only path that "offers to restart."
- **Window chrome:** the **standard native macOS title bar** (#19) — native
  traffic lights, native title (`title: "ReCue"`), native drag, no custom
  positioning. The window config carries no `titleBarStyle`/`hiddenTitle`/
  `trafficLightPosition`, and there is no custom `Titlebar` component or
  `data-tauri-drag-region` (the earlier overlay chrome from #3 was removed). The
  webview content area sits cleanly below the native bar, so the app shell starts
  at the top of the content area (no reserved top strip). **Detached canvas windows
  (#84)** use the same native chrome; they're created from Rust
  (`open_canvas_window`) with the label `canvas-<id>` and a `?canvas=<id>` route, so
  no JS window-create permission is needed — only the `canvas-*` capability so the
  new window can invoke commands + listen to events.
- **Builds & distribution:** `npm run tauri build` produces a local macOS `.app`/`.dmg`
  and Windows NSIS/MSI installers; the **updater artifacts are minisign-signed**. macOS
  builds now carry **Hardened Runtime + `Entitlements.plist`** (#292, `bundle.macOS.
  entitlements`) so mic/voice + protected-folder permissions work and persist — a
  from-scratch local build is still **ad-hoc/self-signed** (sign it with
  `scripts/sign-macos-local.sh`; Gatekeeper still warns until a Developer ID / notarized
  build is produced by adding the `APPLE_*` CI secrets — see the macOS-permissions scope
  note above + `docs/macos-permissions.md`).
  The **in-app auto-update** (#190, **re-introducing** the #15 updater that **#62
  removed** and rebuilding it richer) is **live** (activated once a real minisign
  keypair + GitHub secrets were provided):
  - **Plugins:** `tauri-plugin-updater` + `tauri-plugin-process` (Rust + JS), inited
    in `lib.rs`; `capabilities/default.json` grants `updater:default` +
    `process:allow-restart`. `tauri.conf.json` carries a `plugins.updater` block with
    the GitHub-releases `latest.json` `endpoints` (the `ErikdeJager/ReCue` repo) and the
    **real `pubkey`** (key id `CE271BFBDBF2D714`, the verbatim contents of the root
    `.recue-updater.key.pub`), and **`createUpdaterArtifacts` is ON** so each build
    emits the `.sig` + `latest.json` updater set. The matching **private** key lives in
    the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` / `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` repo secrets.
  - **Frontend:** `src/updater.ts` wraps `check()` / `downloadAndInstall` (progress) /
    `relaunch()`; the store `update` slice (`status`/`version`/`progress`/`error`/
    `confirming`, driven by `checkForUpdate`/`openUpdateConfirm`/`cancelUpdate`/
    `installUpdate`, plus `setUpdateState` for the #193 mock) powers a **sidebar-footer
    `UpdateIndicator`** (above the Settings gear, hidden when idle) → a confirm
    `UpdateModal` → a **full-window input-blocking install overlay with a progress
    bar** → relaunch. A persisted **`last_version`** (Rust scalar, like `sidebar_width`)
    is compared to `app_version()` on boot to show a one-time **"Updated to v…" toast**
    (#190 — the post-update step; also the mock's hook). The Settings → **Updates**
    pane (#191) is the manual review-then-install surface (Check for updates / current
    version / status / Update now); the sidebar indicator deep-links to it.
  - **Patch notes (#192):** per-version notes for the **current** (installed) version are
    authored in-repo as `src/patchnotes/<version>.json` (`{version,date,changes:[{category,
    items[]}]}`), loaded + normalized by the pure `src/patchnotes.ts` (`import.meta.glob`
    eager, `patchnotesFor`/`latestPatchnotes`/`patchnotesToMarkdown`) and rendered by
    `components/PatchNotes` in the Updates pane. For a **not-yet-installed** update, the
    notes ride **inside the release**: the pipeline **constructs** the release body at
    release time (Claude summarizes every change since the last tag — see Pipeline),
    `tauri-action` writes it into `latest.json`'s `notes`, `check()` returns it as
    `update.body`, and the store keeps it as `update.notes` — rendered (markdown) in the
    Updates pane's "What's new" slot so an older client reads them before installing.
  - **Pipeline:** `.github/workflows/release.yml` on push to `main` gates on a
    version bump (config version > latest `v*` tag). When it holds, a `prepare` job asks
    Claude to **construct the release body** from every change since the last tag
    (`scripts/generate-release-body.mjs` — reads the current version, prints the body
    markdown to stdout; **writes/commits nothing**), a `create-release` job opens **one**
    draft GitHub release with that body, and a **2-OS matrix** (`max-parallel: 1`) —
    **macOS** (`universal-apple-darwin`) + **Windows** (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) — builds
    **signed** bundles via `tauri-action` and uploads them **by `releaseId`** to that
    draft, merging one `latest.json` (`darwin-aarch64`, `darwin-x86_64`, `windows-x86_64`).
    Serialized so the `latest.json` read-modify-write merge is deterministic.
  - **Releasing:** the pipeline leaves a **draft** — a maintainer **publishes** it (the
    `/releases/latest/download/latest.json` endpoint only resolves to a published,
    non-draft "latest" release). Each new release = bump `version` in `tauri.conf.json` +
    push to `main` + publish the draft (the release body is constructed automatically);
    optionally add `src/patchnotes/<version>.json` for the **in-app** current-version
    "What's new" once that build is installed. The
    interactive flow is also runtime-exercised by the dev mock (#193). _(This reverses the
    earlier #62 "no in-app auto-update / no release pipeline" rule; the update signatures
    are minisign-only. macOS **code signing** now exists for permissions (#292 — Hardened
    Runtime + entitlements, guarded Developer-ID sign+notarize in `release.yml` that stays
    dormant until the `APPLE_*` secrets are added); Apple **notarization** is thus
    provisioned-but-dormant rather than fully out of scope.)_
  The bundle ships a partial `src-tauri/Info.plist` (auto-merged by the Tauri CLI in
  both `dev` and `build`) declaring `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` /
  `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` so voice dictation works inside a session's PTY
  (macOS attributes a child process's mic request to the responsible app — ReCue).
- **Styling:** CSS Modules (`*.module.css` next to each component) that consume
  the design tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css`. The reset, base styles,
  scrollbars, keyframes, and the `prefers-reduced-motion` killswitch live in
  `src/styles/global.css`. Tokens, global CSS, and the bundled **JetBrains Mono**
  font (`@fontsource`, offline — never a CDN) are imported once in
  `src/main.tsx`. Stay on-system: use tokens, never off-system colors. The color
  tokens are a **Catppuccin Mocha** remap (#33) — accent is **Peach**, with
  `--accent-fg` for readable text on the (light) accent fill, `--scrim` for
  full-window dim overlays, and `--status-*` repointed to Catppuccin accents. A
  custom accent from Settings (#102) overrides `--accent` **and** its derived
  companions `--accent-hover` / `--accent-dim` / `--accent-fg` together
  (`accentCompanions`, #107). See the **Design reference** in `TASK_ARCHIVE.md` (the
  original near-black v1 palette; superseded by the Mocha tokens).

## Tasks

Work is driven by the **`kanban-dev-pima`** pipeline (installed from cc-lib) — an
autonomous, four-lane board over `KANBAN.md` at the repo root. Cards flow strictly left to
right across four columns:

`## PLAN` → `## IMPLEMENT` → `## MERGE` → `## ARCHIVE` → recorded in `TASK_ARCHIVE.md`

Each lane is an independent **monitor-driven** skill (run one per terminal/session as
`/<name>`, **not** via `/loop`): it drains its input column, then arms a `Monitor` on that
column and waits, waking the instant a new card arrives. They coordinate only through the
repo-root board files:

- **The plan lane** ships as **two interchangeable variants** — run **one** at a time in
  the plan terminal; both explore the codebase, assign the next task number `N` (one greater
  than the highest used **anywhere** — board, `PLAN-*.md`, `TASK_ARCHIVE.md`; next is
  **#257**), write a self-contained `PLAN-<N>.md`, set the card's `Dependencies:`, and move it
  to `IMPLEMENT`, producing **identical board output**:
  - **`/plan-assume-kanban-dev`** (autonomous) — where a card is ambiguous it makes the most
    reasonable interpretation itself and **records each call** under a `## Task <N>` section in
    the tracked `ASSUMPTIONS.md`. No interruptions.
  - **`/plan-ask-kanban-dev`** — pauses to **ask clarifying questions** (via `AskUserQuestion`)
    before planning each card, then records your confirmed answers in `ASSUMPTIONS.md` (run it
    in an interactive terminal).
- **`/implement-kanban-dev`** — the one fan-out lane: dispatches up to **5**
  **`worktree-implementer`** subagents in parallel, each building one unblocked `IMPLEMENT`
  card in its own git worktree (`.worktree/<slug>`), running ReCue's checks, and opening a
  PR; the card moves to `MERGE` with its `PR:` url. A card is **unblocked** only when every
  `Dependencies:` task is in `## ARCHIVE` or already in `TASK_ARCHIVE.md`. (Watches `IMPLEMENT`
  + `ARCHIVE` — a landed dependency can unblock a waiting card.)
- **`/merge-kanban-dev`** — lands the topmost `MERGE` card's PR onto `main`, fast-forwards
  local `main`, and moves the card to `ARCHIVE`. Conflicts are resolved through the **forge
  API** (`gh`) — or, when real code conflicts exceed what the API can do, by **dispatching a
  `worktree-implementer`** to resolve them in an isolated worktree — **never** by checking a
  branch out in the main tree.
- **`/archive-kanban-dev`** — appends a `## Task <N>` entry to `TASK_ARCHIVE.md` (the
  permanent, tracked record), deletes the transient `PLAN-<N>.md`, removes the card, and
  commits & pushes.

Card shape (every lane reads/writes it):

```
- [ ] Task <N>: <title> — PLAN-<N>.md
  - Dependencies: <comma-separated task numbers, or "none">
  - PR: <url, once opened>
```

**Board files at the repo root.** `KANBAN.md` (the live board) and `PLAN-<N>.md` (per-task
plans) are **git-ignored / local-only**; `ASSUMPTIONS.md` (refinement decisions) and
`TASK_ARCHIVE.md` (permanent history — #1–#256 to date) are **tracked**. All feature work
happens in isolated worktrees — the **main checkout never leaves its branch**; the plan and
archive lanes commit only their own tracked file (`ASSUMPTIONS.md` / `TASK_ARCHIVE.md`) so the
concurrent lanes don't collide. Task numbers are **global and never reused**. The `(#N)`
provenance markers throughout this doc index back to `TASK_ARCHIVE.md` + git history.

Add work by writing one-line cards under `## PLAN` in `KANBAN.md`; the pipeline numbers,
plans, builds, merges, and archives them. **Never skip a card** — implement every unblocked
card (lowest number first); a card too large for one pass is **split into smaller dependent
cards** (as #93 → #93 + #94), never deferred.
