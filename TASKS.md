# Tasks

This file tracks tasks. Each task is **numbered** (ordered) and has a top-level
**completion marker** — `[ ]` for open, `[x]` for done. Copy the template from
[TASKS-TEMPLATE.md](TASKS-TEMPLATE.md) for every new task and increment the number.

List cross-task ordering in each task's **Depends on** field (e.g. `#2, #3`); tasks
whose dependencies are all complete can run in parallel. The automation skills
(`/handoff`, `/isolate-agent`, `/develop-tasks`) read these fields.

## Project context

**ClaudeCue** — a **macOS** desktop app (**Rust + Tauri 2 + React/TypeScript**) for
running and managing many live `claude` CLI sessions at once: an **Overview** "agent
wall" of real terminals, a **Canvas** split-panel workspace (with file, **git-diff**,
and terminal viewers), and a repo-grouped **sidebar**. Each session is a **real PTY running
`claude`** — ClaudeCue provides the window chrome, navigation, persistence and
git-reading; the terminals come from the Claude Code CLI itself.

**Stack:** Tauri 2 · React + TypeScript + Vite · **Zustand** · plain CSS with
CSS-variable design tokens (CSS Modules) · **xterm.js** terminals · **`portable-pty`**
(Rust) · JSON persistence in the app-data dir · **Lucide** icons · **JetBrains Mono**
(bundled, offline).

**v1 decisions / out of scope:** no status system beyond the busy/idle indicator
(#42/#55/#71 — still no approval pills/awaiting-glow/floating) · no app-rendered
approval UI (users answer in the terminal) · no Archive (single **Remove = kill +
forget**) · no Skills manager · no Fork · no settings screen · no light mode · no
multi-window · no auth · no code signing/notarization · **git is read-mostly** —
ClaudeCue reads git (current branch + working-tree diff vs `HEAD`, branch compare #81)
and never commits or creates branches; its writes are `git checkout <existing branch>`
from the new-session flow (#27) and `git worktree add`/`remove` for isolated worktree
agents (#74). `claude` is assumed on `PATH` (clear in-app error if missing).

> The original design spec and interactive prototype (`HANDOFF.md`,
> `Conductor.dc.html`) are preserved in git history (commit `b02efd8`
> "System referances") if exact prototype details are ever needed.

## Implemented (completed tasks)

> The backlog has fully shipped (#1–#106).
> Completed tasks are condensed here — number, title, and one line
> on what each delivered — and their full entries removed from the list below; per-task
> detail (subtasks, notes, acceptance, implementation reports) lives in git history.
> This is the running record of what ClaudeCue has shipped.

**v1 foundation (#1–#14).** The core: a Tauri 2 shell hosting real `claude` PTYs across
an Overview wall, a Focus view with a git-diff inspector, and a repo-grouped sidebar.

- #1 Project scaffolding — macOS Tauri 2 + React/TS/Vite skeleton + lint/format/test tooling.
- #2 Design tokens, fonts & global styles — CSS-variable tokens + bundled JetBrains Mono.
- #3 Custom window chrome (titlebar) — later replaced by the native title bar (#19).
- #4 Rust session/PTY core — `SessionManager` over `portable-pty`, scrollback + event channel.
- #5 Rust persistence + resume — `sessions.json`; spawn via `claude --session-id`, resume `--resume`.
- #6 Rust git reading — current branch + working-tree diff vs `HEAD`, parsed to a structured shape.
- #7 Frontend app shell + Zustand store + typed IPC + cross-cutting actions.
- #8 xterm.js terminal component — live PTY I/O, fit/resize, exit overlay.
- #9 Sidebar — repo groups + session rows from persisted recents.
- #10 New session modal — folder picker + recents + optional name.
- #11 Overview wall — equal-width live terminal columns.
- #12 Focus view + toolbar — large terminal + collapsible inspector tab strip.
- #13 Git Diff inspector — summary + file list + unified/split hunks.
- #14 Packaging + docs — branded icon, unsigned `.app`/`.dmg`, README/CLAUDE.

**Release/update (#15) — later removed.**

- #15 Release CI + in-app auto-update (Tauri updater). _Reversed by #62 (repo went private)._

**Polish passes 1–2 (#16–#17).**

- #16 App-wide smoothness / performance / UX polish pass 1.
- #17 Polish pass 2 — re-profile and refine.

**UX-feedback batch (#18–#32).** Native chrome, keyboard nav, the new-session/branch flow.

- #18 Fix garbled terminal rendering on view switch/resize/new agents — persistent terminal pool.
- #19 Native macOS title bar (replaces the #3 custom chrome).
- #20 Stable, alphabetical sidebar repo list (no reorder on new agent).
- #21 Sidebar agent labels = branch name, with an optional custom name sub-line.
- #22 Clicking a sidebar agent navigates in Overview (doesn't force Focus).
- #23 Selected-agent border/highlight in Overview.
- #24 Keyboard nav — Shift+arrows between agents and views.
- #25 Overview/Focus toggle moved into the sidebar (always visible).
- #26 Slimmer New session button + ⌘N shortcut.
- #27 New session popover with branch auto-detect + `git checkout` (the one git write).
- #28 Session chip copies a `claude --resume` command, not the bare id.
- #29 Auto-refresh the git diff inspector (no manual refresh).
- #30 Restore sessions live on startup — "reconnecting", not an error wall.
- #31 Right-click a repo → Forget (kill its agents, drop from recents).
- #32 One toast on close; all toasts bottom-right.

**Theming, repo identity & customizable workspace (#33–#47).**

- #33 Catppuccin Mocha recolor (less black; status tokens now in use).
- #34 Non-collapsible sidebar repo titles + click-to-filter Overview.
- #35 Per-repo color identity (assign / persist / change).
- #36 Overview grouped by repo with colored badges + repo filter.
- #37 Repo color + badge in Focus.
- #38 Customizable Overview — mixed panels (agent / diff / markdown columns).
- #39 Diff-viewer column in Overview (from the repo menu).
- #40 Markdown viewer in the Focus inspector (pick a file, render, hot-reload).
- #41 Markdown-viewer column in Overview.
- #42 Busy indicator — show when a `claude` session is working.
- #43 Overview drag-to-reorder agents/panels within a repo cluster (dnd-kit).
- #44 Universal read-only file viewer (markdown rendered/raw + light code highlighting).
- #45 Sidebar tree — opened files under their repo (draggable + clickable).
- #46 Canvas mode — recursive split-panel (BSP) layout engine.
- #47 Canvas content + drag-and-drop from the sidebar (agents, files, diffs).

**Iteration passes 3–4 (#48–#49).**

- #48 UI visual polish & design-system consistency (full color + spacing tokenization, focus a11y).
- #49 UX, interaction flows & accessibility (modal focus-trap, tablist keyboard nav, a11y labels).

**Refinements (#50–#54).**

- #50 Overview selected-agent border — repo color, thinner & subtler.
- #51 Resizable Focus inspector (drag to expand/minimize) + responsive content.
- #52 Custom checkbox component (replaces native checkboxes app-wide).
- #53 Redefine the start-a-new-agent model — a panel that expands from the button, recents-first.
- #54 Repo context menu — "New session" first + red/danger styling for destructive actions.

**Final feature batch + cleanup (#55–#62).**

- #55 Busy indicator — single pulsing ball (dim when idle) + echo-aware detection (typing ≠ busy).
- #56 Searchable file-picker for the repo "Open file viewer" menu.
- #57 Rename an agent from the sidebar (right-click) — propagates everywhere.
- #58 Canvas tabs — multiple named canvases (add/close/rename/reorder), each its own layout.
- #59 Folders as the source of truth — unified sidebar items (file + diff) all draggable into Canvas.
- #60 Final docs pass — sync CLAUDE.md/README.md to the code + condense this list (this task).
- #61 New-session keyboard-speed pass — command-palette launcher (type-ahead recents, ⌘1–9, quick-repeat).
- #62 Remove the in-app auto-update mechanism + the baked-in updater secret (repo now private).

**Post-v1 fixes (#63).**

- #63 Clean agent exit (code 0) disappears (kill + forget, no overlay); non-zero/crash & failed boot-resume keep the "Process exited" overlay + Restart — and Restart now resets the pooled terminal so the relaunched agent repaints cleanly instead of appending onto the dead screen.

**New-session & worktree flow (#65–#67, #74).** The two-step launcher and folder-per-branch isolation.

- #65 New session panel fully covers its button (no corner peek).
- #66 Two-step folder→branch keyboard new-session flow — branch filter + main/master/dev priority sort, in-button ⏎/esc hints, Name field removed, action reads "Start" / "Checkout & start".
- #67 Unified session-label rule — branch is the primary title; a custom name (from rename #57) overrides it and the branch becomes the subtitle.
- #74 Isolated worktree agents — ⌘⏎ starts an agent in an app-managed `git worktree` on an existing branch, nested under its parent repo; ref-counted removal keeps a dirty worktree. New git writes (`worktree add`/`remove`).

**Views = Overview + Canvas; keyboard navigation (#75–#79).** Focus retired; the two surviving views gain keyboard parity.

- #75 Removed Focus mode entirely — the app is now just Overview + Canvas (no "Expand to Focus", no Focus keybind/inspector/state).
- #76 Canvas keyboard navigation — Shift+arrows move spatially between panels (active-leaf focus), ⌘1–9 jump to canvas N.
- #77 ⌘\ toggles the main view (Overview ↔ Canvas).
- #78 Tighter terminal line height (xterm `lineHeight` 1.5 → 1.2).
- #79 Unified, view-aware sidebar item click — select/jump to any item without ever switching views.

**New view types, diff modes & the repo "Views" menu (#72, #80–#82).** More addable panels and richer diffs.

- #72 Plain terminal item — a real `$SHELL` PTY that behaves like the file/diff viewers (repo menu → Overview column + sidebar row + draggable into Canvas; persisted, fresh shell on boot).
- #80 Diff viewer soft-wraps long lines (`pre-wrap` + `overflow-wrap`) — no horizontal scroll, in unified and split.
- #81 Diff viewer branch-compare mode — a Working-tree ↔ Compare toggle running two-dot `git diff base target` (branches validated; mode + branches persisted on the panel).
- #82 Repo context-menu "Views" section — a single registry drives every addable view type (file / diff / terminal), so a new kind is a one-line addition.

**Viewer, sidebar & indicator polish (#64, #68–#71, #73).** Smaller targeted refinements.

- #64 File viewer right-side margin so content isn't clipped at the right edge.
- #68 Repo filter selector visually encloses its "+" (new-session) button as one control.
- #69 File picker — removed the global focus-ring border on the search input (scoped override).
- #70 Overview — the whole column title bar is the drag handle (not just the corner grip); header buttons still click.
- #71 Activity indicator — moved before the title on every surface and reinvented as a rotating spinner arc (busy) / calm static dot (idle).
- #73 Markdown viewer — a clear two-way Rendered/Raw toggle (replaces the ambiguous single icon).

**Canvas & agent-header refinements (#83, #85–#87).** Final touch-ups after Focus removal.

- #83 Low-key confirmation toasts for closing views and for canvas add/close/rename (info tone; no per-item spam on bulk forget).
- #85 Canvas tab — slightly bigger × close button (easier hit target).
- #86 Re-homed the "copy resume command" button (#28) onto every agent header in Overview & Canvas, after Focus removal (#75) took its old home.
- #87 Removed the "Open in Zed" button and all its logic — UI, store action, IPC wrapper, Tauri command, and the `pty.rs` spawn (shared binary-lookup helpers kept for `claude`).

**Multi-window canvases (#84).** Canvas tabs detach into their own native window.

- #84 Open a canvas in its own window (multi-monitor) — pop-out button on the tab + drag tear-off; a canvas-only `?canvas=<id>` window (`CanvasWindow` over the shared `CanvasSurface`) with its own terminal pool over the shared backend PTYs; pure `computeSessionOwners` keeps one PTY in one window (the other shows a `DetachedNote`); cross-window sync via `canvas://changed` / `canvas://windows`; ⌘1–9 + a detached-tab click raise the window (`focus_canvas_window`); re-dock on close; per-session (not restored on relaunch). Reverses the v1 single-window rule.

**Busy-indicator shimmer (#88).** The agent activity dot reads as a shimmer, not a spinner.

- #88 Replaced the #71 spinner arc with a Claude-style **shimmer** — a calm `--status-idle` dot that, while busy, turns `--status-running` with a soft sheen sweeping across it (animated `background-position` on a `::after`; the dot via `::before`, no extra DOM); fixed ~12px slot (no layout shift); reduced-motion → a solid glowing blue dot.

**New-session branch step (#89).** Informational warning + a never-clipping action row.

- #89 New-session branch step: dropped the acknowledgement checkbox **and** its gate (the destructive-checkout warning is now informational — the alert icon + the same text); the branch-step primary button always reads **Start** (the checkout still happens), and the `.actions` row wraps instead of overflowing the fixed 300px panel. The reusable `Checkbox` (#52) is kept (now unused).

**File-viewer file switcher (#90).** Pick another file from the viewer header.

- #90 File viewer: the header filename is now a **switcher** — clicking it opens a searchable `FilePicker` (#56) popover of the repo's files (shared `FileSwitcher` component) and picking one swaps the viewer **in place**, in both Overview file columns and Canvas file panels; persisted (store `setOverviewPanelFile` / `setLeafFile` via the pure `updateLeafContent`). Same-repo only; `FileViewer` itself unchanged.

**Folder bulk actions (#91).** Kill all agents / close all items, from the repo menu.

- #91 Sidebar repo menu: two destructive bulk actions above "Forget folder" — **Kill all agents** (kill + forget every running agent in the folder, incl. its worktree agents #74; shown only with ≥1 running) and **Close all items** (also removes every non-agent view — each terminal's shell killed — while keeping the folder in recents). Both confirm first when agents are running and emit a single summary toast (store `killAllAgents` / `closeAllItems`, mirroring `forgetRepo`).

**Restart-button stacking fix (#92).** The exit-overlay button is clickable again.

- #92 Fixed the unclickable **Restart** button on the exited-process overlay: the pooled xterm's internal positive-z-index layers were out-stacking the overlay for hit-testing. `.slot` now forms its own stacking context (`z-index: 0`) so those layers stay contained, and `.exitOverlay` sits explicitly above (`z-index: 1`) — so Restart (and the "Reconnecting…" overlay) receive pointer events again.

**Scheduled sessions — engine + launcher (#93, part 1 of 2).**

- #93 Scheduled sessions (part 1): an agent can be **scheduled to launch later**. A "+ Schedule session" sidebar button / **⌘⇧N** opens the new-session modal in **schedule mode** (folder → branch → launch time + optional prompt + name → `create_schedule`); records persist (`store.rs` `schedules`), and a `lib.rs` poll loop fires due ones — checkout + spawn `claude` **pre-seeded with the prompt** (positional `claude --session-id <id> "<prompt>"`, CLI-verified) → a live session, emitting `schedule://fired`; **boot catch-up** for schedules missed while closed; one-shot; pending schedules listed in the sidebar with cancel. The full create/list/cancel/update command surface is exposed for #94.

- #94 Scheduled sessions (part 2): a schedule is now a first-class **draggable item type** — a `CanvasContent` `kind: "scheduled"` (+ a `payloadToContent` case) rendering the shared **`ScheduledPanel`** (an auto-saving launch-time / name / **prompt** editor, debounced → `update_schedule`, + cancel) in the **sidebar** (a draggable row; click selects/jumps #79; × cancels), an **Overview card**, and a **Canvas panel**. Pure frontend on #93's command surface; time helpers in `src/time.ts`.

**Agent items: single-line label + larger activity dot (#95).**

- #95 Slimmed agent items to a single thin line and enlarged the activity dot. The shared `BusyIndicator` (#88) is now a ~10px dot in a ~14px slot (still a fixed slot — no idle↔busy layout shift) everywhere it appears: Overview agent cards + sidebar rows. Agent labels render **only the primary** — the custom name if set, else the branch, with no subtitle line — on all three surfaces (sidebar `SessionRow`, Overview `SessionCard`, Canvas agent panels). The colored repo dot was removed from **every** Overview card (the `.metaDot` on agent / diff / file / scheduled cards) and from Canvas **agent** panels; repo color still reads from each card's colored top band. Canvas non-agent panels keep their dot + meta. Purely visual.

**Worktree agents grouped & badged in Overview/Canvas (#96).**

- #96 A worktree agent (#74) now reads as part of its **parent repo** instead of a foreign-colored stray. A pure `effectiveRepo(session)` (`worktreeParent ?? repoPath`, in `src/paths.ts`) drives Overview grouping / sort / filter, so a worktree agent's card sits **inside the parent's cluster** sharing the parent's color (top band + selection frame) while still labelled with **its own branch** (#95). "This is a worktree" is now a small **"worktree" text badge** (mirroring the sidebar's #74 chip) on the Overview `SessionCard` and the Canvas agent-panel header — never a color difference. Sidebar + `repoColor` unchanged (the fix is *which* repo we color by). Purely visual.

**Auto-named agents from claude's own `ai-title` (#97).**

- #97 An agent with **no custom name** now shows **claude's own session title** rather than the bare branch. A new persisted `auto_name` field (Rust `PersistedSession` + `SessionView`) is filled by a backend **title reader** (`src-tauri/src/title.rs`) that globs the session's `~/.claude/projects/*/<uuid>.jsonl` log by UUID and takes the latest `ai-title` (fallback: the trimmed first `last-prompt`, else the branch). A dedicated **title-worker** thread re-reads it on each busy→idle edge **off the monitor's hot path** (the monitor only pokes it via a channel), emitting `SessionEvent::Name` → `session://name`; `lib.rs` persists + forwards it and the frontend updates `autoName`. `sessionLabel` now resolves **`custom || auto || branch`**, so the title fills the single-line label (#95) everywhere (sidebar / Overview / Canvas) — a user rename (#57) still wins, and it covers interactive, worktree (#74), and scheduled (#93) agents. Best-effort: a missing / unreadable / format-changed log degrades to the branch, and the busy indicator is never stalled.

**Fix: detached canvas window renders its panels (#98).**

- #98 Popping a canvas into its own window (#84) showed an **empty** "open in its own window" placeholder instead of the canvas's panels: `CanvasSurface` reused the main-window guard `detachedCanvasIds.includes(activeCanvasId)`, which is also true in the detached window (it forces `activeCanvasId` to its own detached id). Gated it on `IS_MAIN_WINDOW`, so only the **main** window shows the note while the detached window renders its layout — live agent terminals (it owns its sessions) plus file / diff / terminal panels. One-line frontend fix in `CanvasSurface.tsx`; a PTY is still never drawn in two windows.

**Tighter New ↔ Schedule button gap (#99).**

- #99 Tightened the vertical gap between the sidebar's **New session** and **Schedule session** (#93) buttons from 12px to 4px so they read as one compact cluster — reduced only `.newButton`'s bottom margin (`Sidebar.module.css`); the Schedule button (top margin 0) and the rest of the sidebar spacing are unchanged. Pure CSS.

**Settings screen — infra + Terminal / Sessions / Data sections (#100, part 1).**

- #100 Added an application **Settings** screen (reverses the v1 "no settings screen" rule, as #84 reversed multi-window). A new **thin footer row** pins to the bottom of the sidebar (hairline-topped, laid out for more quick actions) with a **⚙ gear** opening a centered **Settings modal** — scrim + focus-trap + Escape, a left section nav + content pane, a modal-local **draft** applied only on **Save** (Cancel / Escape / scrim discard; + "Reset to defaults"). Settings persist through the Rust store as an opaque `settings` blob (`get_settings` / `set_settings`), merged over **TS-side defaults** so an older `sessions.json` upgrades cleanly. Wired sections: **Terminal** (font size / line height / cursor blink → applied to the **live** pooled xterms + new ones via `terminalPool.applyTerminalSettings`), **Sessions** (auto-name toggle gating #97's `ai-title` label across sidebar / Overview / Canvas), and **Data & About** (open data folder, clear recents, app + `claude` versions — backend `open_data_folder` / `clear_recents` / `app_version` / `claude_version`). **Appearance** (accent + reduce-motion) → #102, **Behavior** (default view + confirm-destructive) → #103.

**Pluggable coding-agent CLI — abstraction + persistence (#101, part 1).**

- #101 Made the coding-agent CLI **pluggable** (part 1 of 2): a new `AgentSpec` abstraction (`src-tauri/src/agents.rs`) — a built-in catalog describing each agent's binary + how it spawns / resumes / seeds a session + capability flags (resume / auto-name / install-hint) — with the **`claude`** spec preserving today's exact flags (`--session-id <uuid>`, `--resume <uuid>`, positional prompt). Each session/schedule now **records its own `agent`** (`PersistedSession` / `ScheduledSession`, serde-default `"claude"`; TS `SessionRecord` / `SessionView` / `ScheduledSession` mirrors + record→view mapping). The spawn/resume **path is generalized off the `"claude"` literal**: `pty.rs` (`spawn_session` / `spawn_session_with_prompt` / `resume_session`) resolves the spec's `binary_name` + arg builders, and `commands.rs` (`spawn_session` / `spawn_worktree_agent` / `create_schedule` / `fire_due_schedules`) + the `lib.rs` boot-resume loop thread the agent (default Claude, stored on the record, resumed with the **stored** agent). **Claude is still the only agent and behaves identically** (verified). Codex spec + Settings "Agent" select + resume-capability gating + missing-binary / auto-name / UI-copy generalization remain for a future part 2.

**Settings — Appearance section (#102).**

- #102 Wired the **Appearance** section of the Settings modal (#100): an **accent color** swatch picker over the Catppuccin palette (`REPO_PALETTE`) — the chosen hex overrides the `--accent` token on `:root` (Peach is the default, stored as `""` so the token stands) — and a **Reduce motion** toggle that forces the motion killswitch on via a `body.reduce-motion` class (mirroring the `prefers-reduced-motion` block in `global.css`). Both apply on Save + boot through the store's `applySettingsEffects` (DOM-guarded for the test env); the `accentColor` / `reduceMotion` fields + persistence already existed (#100). Behavior section → #103.

**Settings — Behavior section (#103).**

- #103 Wired the **Behavior** section of the Settings modal (#100), completing its five sections: a **Default view on launch** segmented choice (Overview / Canvas) — applied once at boot in the store's `init` (main window only, so a mid-session view change is never overridden) — and a **Confirm destructive actions** toggle (default on) gating the Sidebar repo menu's three confirm steps (Forget folder / Kill all agents / Close all items — the `menuMode` state machine): off → the action runs immediately, on → the confirm sub-view shows (#91). Frontend-only; the `defaultView` / `confirmDestructive` fields + persistence already existed (#100).

**Detached canvas window — panel content scrolls (#104).**

- #104 Fixed overflowing panel content being **clipped with no scrollbar** in a detached canvas window (#84): the window wrapper `.body` (`CanvasWindow.module.css`) was a plain block, so the shared `CanvasSurface` `.area` (`flex: 1; min-height: 0; overflow: hidden`) had no bounded height — it grew to content height and each panel's internal scroller never engaged. Made `.body` a **flex column** (mirroring the main window's `.canvas` wrapper) so the height chain cascades and long FileViewer / diff / code content scrolls. CSS-only; the main-window Canvas was already correct.

**Detached canvas window — DOM renderer fixes garbled agent terminals (#105).**

- #105 Agent (`claude`) terminals rendered **garbled** — doubled/ghosted glyphs, misaligned box-drawing — in a detached canvas window (#84), a known **WebGL glyph-atlas / `devicePixelRatio`** artifact in a freshly-opened secondary native window. Fix: skip the `WebglAddon` in detached windows (`terminalPool.ts`, guarded by `!IS_MAIN_WINDOW`) so they use xterm's **DOM renderer** (visually equivalent, no artifact); the main window keeps WebGL, so its rendering is **provably unchanged** (the guard is true there). **Runtime-unverified** — xterm rendering isn't unit-testable and a window can't be popped out in the dev environment, so flagged for manual verification (per the #84 precedent); a residual stale-scrollback-replay contribution, if any, is a follow-up.

**Forget folder — complete teardown of items + schedules (#106).**

- #106 Made the repo menu's **Forget folder** (#31) a *complete* teardown: it killed the folder's agents but left its non-agent items (file/diff viewers, shell terminals #72 with PTYs still running) and pending schedules behind. Factored #91's item-teardown out of `closeAllItems` into a shared `closeRepoItems` helper (kills each terminal PTY as intentional, drops `overviewPanels[repoPath]`, prunes `terminalExits`, persists the cleared list) and called it from `forgetRepo` too; `forgetRepo` also **cancels the folder's pending scheduled sessions** (#93/#94, by `cwd`) and reports everything removed (agents + views + scheduled) in one summary toast. `closeAllItems` is unchanged (still keeps the folder in recents — the only difference between the two).

## Tasks

Tasks #1–#106 are complete — see **Implemented (completed tasks)** above for the index,
and git history for full per-task detail. **Open tasks are listed below.** New work goes
here as a fresh `### N.` entry in [TASKS-TEMPLATE.md](TASKS-TEMPLATE.md) format, with
its `Depends on:` prerequisites.

> **Implementing tasks — never skip one.** The agent implementing this backlog
> (`/develop-tasks`, `/isolate-agent`, `/handoff`) MUST implement **every** open task
> whose dependencies are all complete — take the lowest-numbered such `### N.` first —
> and must **never skip a task because it looks big, risky, or hard to verify**. Size is
> not a reason to defer: a task that is genuinely too large for one pass must be **split
> into smaller dependent sub-tasks** first (as #93 was split into #93 + #94), and then
> one of those is implemented — skipping is never the answer. Every task is carried to a

### 107. [ ] Changing the accent color doesn't update hover / dim / on-accent tokens (button hover stays Peach)

**Status:** Not started
**Depends on:** none _(builds on shipped #102 Appearance/accent, #100 Settings, #33/#35 tokens — all complete)_
**Created:** 2026-06-21

**Description**

After choosing a non-default **accent color** in Settings → Appearance (#102), **button hover
still shows the original orange (Catppuccin Peach)** instead of the chosen color — bad UX. The
same applies to other accent-derived surfaces (selected rows / dim backgrounds).

Root cause: `applySettingsEffects` (`src/store.ts:259`) overrides **only** `--accent` on
`:root` when a custom accent is set (`root.style.setProperty("--accent", s.accentColor)`); it
never touches the **derived** accent tokens defined in `src/styles/tokens.css`:
`--accent-hover` (button/control hover + active states — used in **6** CSS modules),
`--accent-dim` (selected-row / dim accent backgrounds — **5** modules), and `--accent-fg`
(readable text/icons **on** the accent fill — **8** modules). Those keep their hard-coded
Peach values, so hover stays orange (the reported symptom), dim backgrounds stay orange-tinted,
and on-accent text contrast could break for a dark accent.

Fix: when a custom accent is applied, also set `--accent-hover`, `--accent-dim`, and
`--accent-fg` derived from the chosen color; when the accent is cleared (default `""`),
`removeProperty` all of them (mirroring today's `--accent` clear) so the Catppuccin defaults
stand. Derivation approach is the implementer's choice:
- **Runtime-compute from the hex** — `--accent-hover` = a lightened shade, `--accent-dim` =
  the hex as `rgba(...)` at ~0.14 alpha (matching the default), `--accent-fg` = black/white by
  the color's luminance for contrast; or
- **A per-palette map** keyed on `REPO_PALETTE` (`store.ts:183` — the picker's fixed Catppuccin
  swatch set, #102/#35), giving exact on-brand companion shades.

Scope: the user reported **hover**, but the single root cause affects `--accent-dim` and
`--accent-fg` too, so the fix covers **all** accent-derived tokens (fixing hover alone would
leave dim/fg wrong). `--accent-fg` is contrast-safety: today's `REPO_PALETTE` is all light
pastels, so dark fg already reads — keep it correct rather than regress it.

Out of scope: the accent picker UI itself (#102, works) and the existing `--accent` override
(works); unrelated `--status-*` and `--syn-accent` tokens.

**Subtasks**

1. [ ] Provide the accent companions for a chosen color — a small hex→{hover, dim, fg} helper
   (lighten / rgba-at-0.14 / luminance-based fg), or a `REPO_PALETTE`-keyed lookup.
2. [ ] In `applySettingsEffects`, when `s.accentColor` is set, also `setProperty` for
   `--accent-hover`, `--accent-dim`, and `--accent-fg`; when it's `""`, `removeProperty` all
   three (alongside the existing `--accent` clear) so defaults stand.
3. [ ] Verify across the app: pick each palette accent and confirm button hover/active, the
   selected-row / dim accent backgrounds, and text-on-accent all track the chosen color;
   reset-to-default restores the Peach hover/dim/fg; reduce-motion + terminal settings
   unaffected.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Choosing a custom accent updates button hover/active color everywhere (no residual
  orange), plus dim/selected accent backgrounds and on-accent text/icons.
- [ ] Resetting the accent to default restores the Catppuccin Peach hover/dim/fg.
- [ ] On-accent text stays readable for the chosen accent (fg correct for the palette).
- [ ] `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` pass.

**Notes**

- Derived-token reach (why `--accent`-only is visibly incomplete): `--accent-hover` 6 files,
  `--accent-dim` 5 files, `--accent-fg` 8 files.
- The picker is the fixed Catppuccin `REPO_PALETTE`, so a per-palette map is viable; runtime
  derivation also covers any future free-hex input. Both apply on Save + boot via
  `applySettingsEffects` (already DOM-guarded for the test env).

### 108. [ ] Resizable sidebar — drag the right edge to set its width (min 180 / max 560, persisted)

**Status:** Not started
**Depends on:** none _(builds on the #9 sidebar + #100 settings/persistence infra — both complete)_
**Created:** 2026-06-21

**Description**

The left **Sidebar** is a fixed `width: 260px` (`src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.module.css:4`),
rendered as a flex child of `.app-body` beside `<main>` (`src/App.tsx:98-100`). Make it
**drag-resizable**: a thin draggable divider on the sidebar's **right edge** lets the user drag
to widen / narrow it, **clamped to min 180px / max 560px**, defaulting to **260px**. The chosen
width **persists across restarts** (restored on boot, re-clamped to the range).

Approach (implementer's choice, recommended): a **custom edge drag-handle** is the most
localized fit — a thin hit-target on the sidebar's right border that, on pointer drag, updates a
width value (clamped) applied to the sidebar (inline width / CSS var), with the standard
`col-resize` cursor; this avoids restructuring the app shell or the app-level dnd-kit context
(#47) that spans the sidebar. (The existing `react-resizable-panels` (#46) could instead wrap
`.app-body`, but it sizes in %, makes px min/max awkward, and risks the shell / DnD wiring —
hence the custom handle is preferred.)

Persistence: store the width as a **dedicated persisted value** (mirroring how recents /
canvases persist via their own IPC), **not** inside the #100 Settings blob — the Settings modal
applies a modal-local draft on Save, which could overwrite a mid-session drag. On boot, read +
clamp the value; if absent, use 260.

Scope:

- **Main window only** — the detached `CanvasWindow` (#84) has no sidebar.
- The min keeps the sidebar fully usable (repo names + New / Schedule buttons); **no
  collapse / hide** (out of scope — the min width keeps it visible).

Out of scope: collapsing / hiding the sidebar; resizing anything else (Canvas already resizes
via #46); any change to the detached window.

**Subtasks**

1. [ ] Add a draggable resize handle on the sidebar's right edge (thin hit-target, `col-resize`
   cursor, accent on hover / drag) that updates the sidebar width on pointer drag.
2. [ ] Clamp the width to **[180, 560]** and apply it to the sidebar (replace the hard-coded
   `width: 260px` with the dynamic value; keep 260 as the default).
3. [ ] Persist the width as a dedicated value (its own store field + IPC get / set, like
   recents) and restore + clamp it on boot.
4. [ ] Ensure the drag is smooth (pointer capture) and the rest of the layout (main content,
   Overview / Canvas) reflows correctly at every width; main-window only.
5. [ ] (Optional) Double-click the handle to reset to 260.

**Acceptance criteria**

- [ ] Dragging the sidebar's right edge resizes it live; the width is clamped to 180–560px and
  cannot go beyond either bound.
- [ ] The chosen width survives an app restart (restored, re-clamped on boot).
- [ ] The main content area (Overview / Canvas) reflows to the remaining space at every width.
- [ ] The sidebar stays usable at the min and doesn't break layout at the max; detached canvas
  windows are unaffected.
- [ ] `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` pass.

**Notes**

- Today's fixed width lives at `Sidebar.module.css:4` (`width: 260px`); `.app-body` (flex) is in
  `src/styles/global.css`.
- Persisted separately from the #100 Settings blob to avoid the Settings-modal draft clobbering
  a mid-session drag (per decision).
