# Assumptions

This file records assumptions and judgment calls made **autonomously** when the user is
not available to answer clarifying questions.

## Standing directive (2026-06-26)

The user stated they will no longer respond in the refine/loop chat. From now on, when a
question would normally go to the user, **make the best decision yourself, proceed, and
record the assumption here** (newest entries at the bottom of the relevant task section).
Each entry: what was ambiguous, the decision taken, and the rationale — enough that the
choice can be revisited later.

## TASK-186 — Distribute Canvas panels evenly

The user *did* answer the two refine questions before going silent (recorded in
TASK-186.md Notes): both a tab-strip button **and** a border double-click; "equal size for
every panel" semantics. The following were decided autonomously (the user delegated UX
judgment with "see if this … has good UX"):

- **Border double-click scope = the double-clicked split's subtree (region), not the whole
  canvas.** The tab-strip button equalizes the whole canvas; the border gesture evens out
  only the panels that border divides. Rationale: two distinct, learnable tools beat two
  triggers for the identical action. Trivial to switch to whole-canvas later
  (`equalizeCanvas()` vs `equalizeCanvas(node.id)`).
- **"Equal" = equal area via leaf-count weighting** (each split's sizes ∝ its children's
  leaf counts). Provably gives every panel an equal share; for a simple row it is exact
  equal widths. Chosen over per-split 50/50 (which the user explicitly rejected).
- **Sizes stored as percentages summing to 100** (e.g. `[33.33, 66.67]`) to match the rest
  of the codebase (`[50,50]`, `[70,30]`), even though react-resizable-panels would accept
  relative weights.
- **Visual update via the `Group` `groupRef` imperative `setLayout`, never a key-bump
  remount.** `defaultLayout` is initial-only; a remount would churn the #18 terminal pool.
  A guarded reconcile effect (skip when the live layout already matches) keeps user
  drag-resize a no-op and avoids feedback loops.
- **Button is main-window-only** (the tab strip doesn't exist in detached canvas windows
  #84); the border double-click is the equalize affordance there. Accepted rather than
  duplicating the button into detached windows.
- **Icon = a Lucide "even grid" glyph (`LayoutGrid`/`Grid2x2`), label "Distribute panels
  evenly."** Matches the user's own word "distribute"; final glyph left to the implementer.
- **Button disabled when the active canvas has < 2 panels** (nothing to equalize).
- **10% min-size floor accepted as-is:** equal area past ~10 panels in one nesting chain
  can't dip below each Panel's `minSize="10%"`; the library clamps. No special handling —
  fine for typical 2–6 panel canvases.

---

## TASK-187 — "Save current canvas as template"

- **Trigger = a new item in the existing ▾ Templates menu** ("Save current canvas as
  template…"), not a separate toolbar button. Most consistent with "New template…".
- **Live→block mapping reuses the registry's `liveKind`** (reverse lookup, single source of
  truth) and **reuses each leaf's existing id** so the mapper stays pure/deterministic (no
  `crypto.randomUUID`; the editor deep-clones on open and instantiation reassigns ids).
  Split `dir` + `sizes` preserved.
- **Agent blocks carry the custom session name only** — not the auto-title (#97, not a
  deliberate label) and **not a prompt** (a live agent has a conversation, not a single
  recoverable initial prompt). The user can add a prompt in the editor before saving.
- **`repoPath` dropped** from file/kanban blocks (templates are folder-agnostic; the repo is
  chosen at use time). Only the relative `file` path travels.
- **`diff` → `open-diff` is working-tree only**; a branch-compare (#81) panel is not
  preserved as a compare.
- **`scheduled`/`pending` panels are dropped** (split collapses like `removeLeaf`); a canvas
  with nothing templatable → toast + no-op (don't open an empty editor).
- **Default template name = the active canvas's tab name** (editable before Save).
- **Seeding via new `templateEditorSeed`/`templateEditorSeedName` store fields**, cleared in
  `closeTemplateEditor` (mirrors the mounted-only-while-open editor). The draft is unsaved
  until the user hits Save (consistent with "New template…").
- **Depends on: none** — the whole template system (#117/#118) is already shipped.

---

## TASK-188 — Double-click header to rename the agent

- **Renamable = agents only.** Non-agent panels (file/diff/terminal/kanban/filetree) have
  derived titles with no custom-name concept; scheduled panels have their own name editor
  (#94). Double-clicking their header is a no-op.
- **Surfaces = Canvas panel headers + Overview agent card headers** (the "drag bars"). The
  sidebar already has inline rename via its row context menu (#57) and its rows aren't
  header bars, so it's left unchanged.
- **Reuse the existing inline-rename machine** (sidebar #57 / `CanvasTabs` double-click):
  input seeds the current custom name, placeholder = the derived label, **empty commit
  clears** the custom name (reverts to auto-title/branch) via `renameSession`'s
  `trim()→null`. Enter/blur commit, Escape cancels, `committed` guard prevents double-commit.
- **Coexists with dragging** via the existing 4px PointerSensor activation distance; the
  rename `<input>` stops `pointerdown` so the header's drag listeners can't grab it.
  `preventDefault` on the double-click stops title-text selection.
- **Distinct DOM target from #186** (separator double-click = distribute evenly); the header
  double-click = rename. No conflict.
- **Depends on: none** — `renameSession`, draggable headers (#70/#144), and the inline-rename
  pattern are all shipped.

---

## TASK-189 — Keyboard-driven panel-creation modal

- **The user's literal "Cmd+1 = session" is impossible**: ⌘1–9 are already global
  canvas-jump (#76), and ⌘⇧+digit clashes with macOS screenshots (⌘⇧3/4/5). Resolution:
  - **Opener = ⌘K** (free; command-palette convention) → opens the modal at the type step.
  - **In-modal digits 1–6** select the type (primary, discoverable realization of "1=session,
    2=file…").
  - **Global ⌘⌥1–6** open the modal at the folder step for that type (the literal "individual
    panel keybind" with a free modifier; ⌘-combos never reach the PTY).
- **Type order:** 1 Session · 2 File · 3 Diff · 4 Terminal · 5 Kanban · 6 File tree — reuses
  the `ViewsMenu`/block-registry set so it stays in sync with addable types (adds **no** new
  view type, so the #82 Views-menu dependency rule is unaffected).
- **The modal orchestrates existing actions** — session → `startRepoSession(folder)` (reuses
  the #127 branch/worktree flow); file/kanban → `FilePicker` → `addOverviewPanel`/
  `createKanbanBoard`; diff/terminal/filetree → `addOverviewPanel`. No new creation logic.
- **Target step = folder**: open repos + their worktrees + recents + Browse… (reuses the
  new-session folder UX). This is the "repo or repo-worktree selection".
- **New panels land in sidebar + Overview** (Views path), draggable into Canvas; **not**
  auto-inserted into the active Canvas BSP layout (deferred to avoid a split-target decision).
- **Main-window only; inert while another modal is open.** Existing ⌘1–9 canvas-jump
  unchanged.
- **Depends on: none** — all underlying machinery is shipped.

---

## TASK-190 — Auto-update skeleton (keys deferred)

- **Reverses #62 + reuses #15.** Rebuild the removed #15 updater (git `24791c4`) as the base,
  richer (gated pipeline + sidebar box + confirm/freeze/progress + post-update toast). The
  implementer updates CLAUDE.md/README to undo the #62 "no auto-update / no pipeline" note.
- **Keys deferred → placeholder pubkey + `createUpdaterArtifacts` OFF**, so local
  `tauri build` keeps producing an **unsigned** bundle with no key (build-safety is a hard
  requirement). A later "provide signing key" task bakes the real pubkey, flips
  `createUpdaterArtifacts`, and adds the GitHub secrets — no other code change ("ready to go").
- **Pipeline guards on BOTH a version bump (from #15) AND the signing-secret presence**; ends
  early otherwise (the card's "ends early if the secret isn't present"). Draft release per
  version via `tauri-action`.
- **Indicator = a box in the sidebar footer above the Settings gear** (per the card). **Freeze
  = a full-window input-blocking `--scrim` overlay** + progress bar bound to the updater's
  download events; then `relaunch()`.
- **Post-update toast** via a persisted `lastVersion` compared to Tauri `getVersion()` on boot
  — also the hook the mock (#193) reuses.
- **Testability:** with no key/release the live download can't run; the store `update` state
  machine is shaped so the **mock task (#193) drives every state**. #190's own verification is
  build/lint/test + workflow-guard review + idle UI rendering.
- **Depends on: none** — it is the **foundation**; the other 3 update cards (settings update
  screen, patchnotes, mock) depend on #190.

---

## TASK-191 — Settings → "Updates" section

- **"Alternative settings screen" = a new "Updates" section in the existing Settings modal**
  (not a separate window), following the modal's `SECTIONS` pattern.
- **Reuses #190 entirely** (the `update` slice, `checkForUpdate`/`installUpdate`, freeze/
  progress/restart) — adds only UI + a deep-link. No new updater logic.
- **The #190 indicator deep-links here** (`setSettingsOpen(true, "updates")`), making the
  Updates pane the primary "review what will be installed → install" surface; #190's minimal
  confirm modal becomes redundant for that path (implementer reconciles — don't build two
  competing confirm surfaces).
- **"What will be installed" = a labelled slot** in this pane; the patch-notes content is
  **#192** (which renders into it).
- **Update actions are immediate** (not draft-staged), like Data & About's actions.
- **Depends on: #190.** #192 (patchnotes) depends on this #191; #193 (mock) is how these panes
  get exercised before a real signed release exists.

---

## TASK-192 — Patch notes (baked-in JSON + release-carried notes)

- **Smart solution for "read notes of a not-yet-installed update":** carry the new version's
  notes **in the release** via the Tauri updater `latest.json` `notes` / `update.body`
  (generated from that version's patch-notes JSON); the running older app renders
  `update.notes`. The baked-in JSON is the authored **source** + the current/past changelog.
- **One JSON file per version** under `src/patchnotes/<version>.json`,
  `{version,date,changes:[{category,items[]}]}`, categories feature/fix/improvement/other;
  loaded via `import.meta.glob` (eager), normalized best-effort; rendered with the existing
  react-markdown stack (no new dep).
- **Pipeline:** a guard that the bumped version has a matching patch-notes file (else end
  early) + a step that generates the release body from it (`scripts/patchnotes-to-md.mjs`).
- **Extends #190's `update` slice with a `notes` field** (populated from `update.body`),
  rendered into **#191's "What's new" slot**.
- **Depends on: #190, #191.** #193 (mock) should set `update.notes` so this view is testable
  before a real release.
- **Working-tree note:** an implementing agent was concurrently editing Canvas/store files
  (#186, since completed) — this refine staged only its own 3 files, never `-A`.

---

## TASK-193 — Dev-only mock update

- **"Insert a command" = a dev-gated `window.__claudecue` console helper** (`mockUpdate`/
  `mockProgress`/`mockError`/`clearUpdate`), plus an optional dev-only "Simulate update"
  button in the #191 Updates pane.
- **Dev-only via `import.meta.env.DEV`** — registered under the guard so it's absent from
  production builds (verify it's gone in `tauri build`).
- **Simulated install** = a **mock flag in `updater.ts`**: `installUpdate` animates progress
  0→100 on a timer and fires the post-update toast **without** the real plugin or a relaunch.
- **Sets `update.notes`** (the #192 field) so it exercises the patch-notes render too.
- **Depends on: #190, #191, #192** — the mock exists to test the full update UI; it drives
  every field those three add. Matches the lowest-number-first implement order.

---

## TASK-194 — Kanban optional card checkbox

- **Tri-state `Card.checked: boolean | null`** (null = no checkbox `- title`, false = `- [ ]`,
  true = `- [x]`) — minimal lossless model, chosen over a separate `hasCheckbox` flag.
- **Parse:** a plain-bullet branch tried **after** `CARD_RE` (so checkbox cards still win);
  **serialize** emits `null` as `- title` for a byte-stable round-trip.
- **Render:** `KanbanPanel` omits the `<Checkbox>` + `cardDone` for a null card (both render
  sites); still draggable/editable/deletable.
- **UI-created cards still default to `- [ ]`**; plain bullets originate from the markdown. No
  new UI to toggle a checkbox on/off. Only `- ` bullets (not `*`/`+`/numbered).
- **Depends on: none** — self-contained engine + minimal render change; independent of the
  "Clean up Kanban card UI" card (which should account for the optional checkbox).

---

## TASK-195 — Clean up Kanban card UI

- **Web-researched pattern adopted** (Trello/Linear/shadcn-kanban): **edit+delete hidden at
  rest, revealed on `.card:hover`/`:focus-within`** in a top-right cluster; **title full-width**;
  checkbox + grip kept quiet. Frees the title of the crowding action icons.
- **Keyboard/touch fallback:** reveal on `:focus-within` (not hover-only) + keep click-to-edit
  on the title, so actions never depend solely on hover.
- **Layout/CSS-only** — no dnd re-architecture, no new card content (labels/dates); all
  behavior (toggle/edit/delete/drag/body-checkboxes) preserved; `CardPreview` kept consistent.
- **Must render #194's `null` (no-checkbox) card** (title flush-left, no gap) — hence the dep.
- **Depends on: #194** — building before it would conflict on `KanbanPanel`'s checkbox render;
  lowest-number-first implements #194 first.

---

## TASK-196 — Worktree header: icon marker + inline new-session button

- **Drop the literal "worktree" text badge**; keep the existing `GitBranch` icon (already
  distinguishes a worktree from the repo's `Folder` icon #128) + an accessible "worktree"
  title. `FolderGit2` noted as a clearer alternative; minimal change keeps `GitBranch`.
- **Inline "+" mirrors the repo header's `+`** → `spawnWorktreeSession(parent, branch)` (a
  session, like the repo `+` does `startRepoSession`); disabled when the parent is unknown.
  Other panel types stay in the worktree's right-click `ViewsMenu` (#164), exactly as for repos.
- **Layout-only** beyond that; compact rail unchanged; right-click menu intact.
- **Depends on: none** — reuses shipped `spawnWorktreeSession` (#166) + the repo `+` pattern.
  Sibling worktree cards (filter-on-click, schedule-into-worktree, auto-delete guard) touch the
  same component but aren't prerequisites.

---

## TASK-197 — Click a worktree to filter Overview

- The Overview filter matches `effectiveRepo === filter`, but a worktree's `effectiveRepo` is
  its **parent** (#96) → broaden the predicate to `effectiveRepo === filter || repoPath ===
  filter` so a worktree folder can be the filter; make the worktree header name clickable →
  `setOverviewRepoFilter(dest)` (toggle), no view switch. **Depends on #196** (same
  `WorktreeHeader`, sequenced to avoid edit conflicts).

## TASK-198 — Schedule a session into a worktree

- Add a serde-default `worktree` flag to `ScheduledSession`; an **explicit "Start in a
  worktree" toggle** in the schedule branch step (clearer than a hidden ⌘⏎ for a deferred
  flow); create the worktree at **fire time** (`worktree_add[_new_branch]`, like #125 defers
  branch creation); **cancel cleanup reuses #199's broadened guard** so a cancelled schedule
  never orphans a worktree. **Depends on #199.**

## TASK-199 — Worktree auto-delete guard (THE confirmed bug)

- The card asked to verify the guard covers all item types — it **does not**:
  `cleanupWorktreeIfEmpty` (store.ts ~2737) counts **agents only**. So authored as a **fix**
  (not removed): a pure `worktreeHasItems(state, dest)` counting sessions + `overviewPanels
  [dest]` + schedules; trigger on **every** close (panel/schedule too, not just agent); count
  exited-but-shown agents; dirty worktree still kept. **Depends on: none** (foundational for
  #198/#200).

## TASK-200 — Worktree removal must not freeze the UI

- Root cause: `remove_worktree` is a **sync** `#[tauri::command]` → runs on the **main thread**
  → the FS delete freezes the webview. Fix = make it `async` + `tauri::async_runtime::
  spawn_blocking`; frontend cleanup made fire-and-forget (item removed instantly, dir deletes
  in background, dirty-kept toast preserved). **Depends on #199** (shared cleanup path).

## TASK-201 — One "New session" in the folder/worktree menu

- Add `includeNewSession?: boolean` (default true) to the shared `ViewsMenu`; the repo context
  menu **and** the worktree header menu (both already render a top-level "New session") pass
  `false`; the standalone `WorktreeViewsBadge` popover keeps it. Keep the top-level action
  (repo: `startRepoSession` branch-aware; worktree: `spawnWorktreeSession` reuse). **Depends
  on: none.**

## TASK-202 — File-tree search (filename + content)

- Content search is **absent** (only filename `search_files`) → new bounded backend
  `search_file_contents` (reuse `search_collect` walk + skip/validation, size/per-file/result
  caps, deterministic, truncation surfaced); plain case-insensitive substring (no regex);
  **in-panel** (tree↔results toggle), snippet "mini viewer" with the match highlighted, per-
  result **Reveal in tree** (new expand-to-path) + **Open** (reuse existing file-open).
  Sizable but kept as one card; adds no new view type. **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-203 — Restyle the sidebar-footer update indicator

Pure visual restyle of the shipped #190 `UpdateIndicator` chip (`Update.module.css`
`.indicator*`). Card asked for: inset from the sidebar edges, smaller, thinner, slicker,
less prominent. Decided autonomously (refine loop, user not answering):

- **Margin = `var(--space-8)` sides/bottom**, aligning with the footer's `0
  var(--space-8)` inset directly below — over the New/Schedule buttons' 12px — so the chip
  ties to the footer it sits above. Drop `width: 100%` (column-flex child stretches by
  default; margins inset it). Trivially retunable.
- **Single-line label** (icon + title + version on one baseline row) as the primary
  "thinner" move, over keeping the 2-line stack with smaller fonts.
- **Hairline border (`--border-hairline`) + transparent fill, accent reserved to the
  icon**, with a subtle `--bg-hover` hover (not the current full accent flood) — the
  "less-prominent / slicker" treatment. Over keeping a lighter accent border or removing
  the border entirely. Icon stays accent so it still reads as a positive, actionable hint.
- **Error variant restyled to match** (inset, single-line, subtle) rather than left as-is.
- **Collapsed rail:** keep icon-only, but center it (`justify-content: center`/modifier)
  so the new margins don't left-stick the icon. **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-204 — Schedule modal: worktree checkbox → ⌘⏎ button/keybind

The new-session and schedule flows are the **same** `NewSessionModal` but express the
"isolated worktree" choice differently: new-session uses a "Worktree ⌘⏎" button + ⌘⏎
keybind in the branch step (#74); schedule uses a checkbox in the schedule step (#198). Card
asked to unify on the new-session pattern. Decided autonomously (refine loop, user not
answering):

- **The worktree button lands on the schedule step (the final action step), next to
  "Schedule", NOT the schedule flow's branch step** — the pattern is "the worktree variant
  of the *primary action* button," and the schedule flow's primary action is Schedule (the
  branch step only advances). Keeps the choice on the same screen the checkbox was on.
- **⌘⏎ / Ctrl+⏎ active across the whole schedule step**, plain ⏎ = normal schedule, and
  Enter still inserts a newline in the prompt textarea / drives the open #114 skill menu.
- **`submitSchedule(asWorktree: boolean)` param** over a retained `worktree` state toggled
  by the button — mirrors the branch step's `create()` vs `createWorktree()` split, avoids
  a setState-before-submit race. Remove `worktree`/`setWorktree`, the `.scheduleWorktree`
  CSS, and the now-unused `Checkbox` import.
- **Backend + `ScheduledPanel` untouched** — `scheduleSession(..., useWorktree)` (#198)
  already takes the flag; ScheduledPanel only shows a read-only "worktree" badge.
  **Depends on: none** (all referenced code ships today).

## TASK-205 — Canvas tab bar: + dropdown + move distribute right

Reorg of the `CanvasTabs` toolbar (+ / distribute / Templates ▾). Card: turn + into a
dropdown offering "New tab" or a template option; move distribute elsewhere (right). Decided
autonomously (refine loop, user not answering):

- **+ dropdown holds the two tab-creation items only** — "New tab" (`addCanvas`) and "New
  tab from template…" (`openTemplateUse`); the latter **moves out of** Templates ▾ into +.
- **Templates ▾ kept for template management** (New template… / Save current canvas as
  template… / Manage templates…). Rejected folding everything into + (a + "add" affordance
  housing "Manage templates…" is semantically off, and broader than the card asked).
- **Distribute (Grid2x2) moves to the far right** via `margin-left: auto`, action/gating
  unchanged. Dropdowns stay `position: fixed` (escape the strip's overflow-x clip, #129).
  **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-206 — ⌘T new-Canvas-tab keybind + UI hint

- **⌘T / Ctrl+T** (unused; conventional "new tab"). Treated as a *create* action (like
  ⌘N/⌘K) → works from anywhere in the **main window** and **switches to Canvas** then
  `addCanvas()` (over a Canvas-view-only scoping like ⌘1–9, which would dead-end from
  Overview). Main-window only, inert while new-session/create-panel modals are open.
- **Surfaced** as a `⌘T` `<kbd>` on the **"New tab"** item of #205's + dropdown + the
  trigger tooltip + the useKeyboardNav legend. **Depends on #205** (the dropdown item is the
  hint's home; #206 builds on #205, not a cycle).

## TASK-207 — Sidebar click in Canvas: jump to Overview if not in canvas

`selectItem` (store.ts) in Canvas view: present-in-active-tab → jump to panel; **not present
→ today deselects + toasts "not present in canvas"** (a dead end). Change the not-present
branch to `set({ view: "overview", selectedId: item.id })`. Decided autonomously:

- **Applies to all item kinds, not just agents** (card says "agent", but the dead-end is
  identical for file/diff/terminal/kanban/schedule and Overview has a column for each, #174).
  Easy to scope to agents later.
- **"Present" = the active canvas tab** (selectItem's existing scope; never switches tabs);
  cross-tab jumps stay with the "Open in canvas" context action / `openSessionInCanvas`
  (#153).
- **No toast on switch**; intentionally reverses #79's "never auto-switch Overview↔Canvas"
  for the not-present case only. selectItem is main-window only (no detached edge).
  **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-208 — Rewrite v0.0.1 patch notes as a first-release intro

Content-only rewrite of `src/patchnotes/0.0.1.json` (today an internal changelog). Card:
introduce what the app is + frame as the first/initial release, not a list of recent
implementations. Decided autonomously:

- Schema has no free-text intro field, so use two categories — **"welcome"** (what ClaudeCue
  is + "first release") and **"highlights"** (Overview / Canvas / sidebar at a high level).
  Arbitrary categories Title-Case via `categoryLabel`.
- Keep `version` 0.0.1 and `date` 2026-06-26. Provided concrete recommended JSON in the
  plan; wording polishable. **Depends on: none** (content-only; no code touched).

## TASK-209 — Fix missing space in Settings → Updates "Current version"

"Current version0.0.1" renders stuck. **Root cause:** `.updates` is `align-items:
flex-start`, so `.field`/`.fieldLabel` shrink-wrap → `.fieldLabel`'s `justify-content:
space-between` collapses → the label text and `.fieldValue` span sit adjacent. Decided:

- Fix via **`gap: var(--space-8)` on `.fieldLabel`** (one line, `Settings.module.css`) — the
  root-cause fix; also corrects the identical "Update available" field (same class). Over a
  per-instance `{" "}` JSX space. **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-210 — Feedback (bug) button in the sidebar footer

Add a Lucide **`Bug`** footer button next to the Settings gear that `openUrl(FORM_URL)`s the
feedback Google Form. Decided autonomously:

- Placement **after the Settings gear** (Settings → Feedback → collapse chevron); 16px icon
  matching the gear; reuse `openUrl` (`src/ipc.ts`, the existing `open_url` command) — no new
  Rust command. No confirm gate (opening a URL is non-destructive). Main-window only (sidebar
  only renders there). Works in the collapsed rail (`footerCollapsed` stacks it).
- **URL used verbatim** as pasted; `?usp=publish-editor` may be a Forms editor-preview link —
  flagged in the plan to swap for the public `…/viewform` URL if it opens the editor.
  **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-211 — Reorder folders in the sidebar by dragging

Card: drag folders up/down to reorder, no separate drag handle. Decided autonomously
(refine loop, user not answering):

- **Reuse the app-level `DndContext` (App.tsx), don't nest a new one.** The sidebar's
  draggable rows (`SessionRow`/`FileRow`/…) are bound to that context so they drop into
  Canvas; a nested context around the repo list would rebind them and break that. Add a
  `SortableContext` (vertical) inside the sidebar as a descendant, handle the
  folder-sort drag in App.tsx `onDragEnd` keyed by a `repohead:` id prefix.
- **Whole repo header is the grip** (no handle) — spread `useSortable` listeners on the
  header; the existing 4px PointerSensor activation distance keeps the title/`+`/right-
  click working.
- **Persist as a dedicated Rust `repo_order: Vec<String>`** (mirror `sidebar_width`
  #108), separate from the Settings blob so a draft can't clobber it.
- **Displayed order = `mergeRepoOrder(folderOrder, repoOrder(...))`** (reuse the pure
  helper) so a spawned repo appends and a forgotten one drops without scrambling.
- **Collapsed-rail drag reordering + worktree-subgroup reordering are out of scope**;
  the rail still reflects the saved order (renders the same `repos`). **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-212 — Keep the worktree branch label in sync after an in-terminal checkout

Card: worktree branch label goes stale when the agent `git checkout`s inside the
worktree. Decided autonomously:

- **Root cause is *when* `refreshBranches` runs, not the backend.** `current_branches`
  already resolves worktree HEADs and is already called with worktree paths (every
  session's `repoPath` is included via `repoOrder`). It just isn't re-run after an
  in-terminal checkout (only on repo-set change + app-initiated spawns/checkouts).
- **Fix = debounced `refreshBranches()` on the session busy→idle edge**, mirroring the
  #97 title-reader cadence; chosen over a poll timer (chattier + laggier).
- **Covers both worktree and normal-repo labels** in one batched call — the worktree is
  the motivating case, but the identical repo staleness is fixed for free; scoping to
  worktrees only would help nothing. A small lag (updates at next idle settle) is
  accepted. **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-213 — Worktree agent header: normal open-view button + static "worktree" badge

Card: "make a worktree agent use the same context-menu button as a normal agent, and
turn the 'worktree' button into a non-clickable badge." Grounded via an Explore sweep;
decided autonomously:

- **"the same context-menu button" = the views-popover trigger on Overview/Canvas
  headers** (`OpenViewButton`). Worktree agents already share the **sidebar** context
  menu (same `SessionRow`); the affordance that actually differs is the clickable
  `WorktreeViewsBadge` (text "worktree") shown *instead of* `OpenViewButton`.
- `OpenViewButton` and `WorktreeViewsBadge` **wrap the same `ViewsPopover`**, so:
  render `OpenViewButton` for worktree agents too (drop the `!worktreeParent` gate;
  `repoPath = session.repoPath` is the worktree folder, so views still open in the
  worktree), and replace the clickable badge with a **static**
  `<span class={worktreeBadge}>worktree</span>` (same class as the "fork" badge).
- **Only Overview + Canvas headers**; sidebar already unified, ScheduledPanel badge
  already static. Remove `WorktreeViewsBadge` if it becomes unused. **Depends on: none.**

## TASK-214 — Make the collapsed sidebar rail much narrower

Card: collapsed rail much narrower, only slightly wider than its icons/buttons.
Decided autonomously:

- **`SIDEBAR_RAIL_WIDTH` 56 → 44** (36px buttons + ~4px gutter each side). The rail's
  10px-per-side slack today comes purely from `(56−36)/2`. Final value tunable after a
  visual check; buttons could drop to 34/32 with a ~40px rail for an even tighter look.
- Pure constant + CSS change, no new state; verify nothing clips (dots, worktree
  glyphs, collapsed footer, collapsed UpdateIndicator icon). **Depends on: none.**
